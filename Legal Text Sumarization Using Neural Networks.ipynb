We are unable to find any fault with this conclusion and we find no sound foundation upon which Mr Matsiko contended that the Court erred when it held that the petitioners ought to have perceived the breach on 17 July 2002. Therefore, the Constitutional Court was absolutely right in holding that the petition, which by virtue of rule 4(1), was expected to be filed within 30 days from 18 July 2002 was filed within time because it was lodged in Court on 31 July 2002 that is to say 14 days after the 30 days begun running.

      "Accordingly, by virtue of section 9(1) of Chapter 25, the Commission became receiver of the judgment debtors property and entitled to take possession; all remedies enjoyed by creditors except secured creditors, whose debts are provable in bankruptcy, are barred, and such creditors are left with a right to prove in bankruptcy; all actions and proceedings against the property and the estate of the debtor are stayed unless their continuance is sanctioned by the court. Insofar as it is relevant to the matter at hand, sub-section (1) of the latter section provides that where a creditor has issued execution against the lands of a debtor, he shall not be entitled to retain the benefits of the execution against the trustee in bankruptcy of the debtor, unless be has completed the execution before the date of the receiving order, which in this case is to be equated with the date of the publication of GN 330A of 1998. With regard to the execution which has issued in miscellaneous civil case number 58 of 1996, Captain Kameja says, and he is right, that the law does not prohibit multiple attachments. The question arises as to whether Cogecot had completed execution upon the assets before the date of the application of the GN 20 is not in dispute that the warrant for the attachment of those assets was executed by the court broker before the GN was published, and the court broker took possession thereof. The crucial question, however, is whether it would be proper to let Cogecot retain such benefits and proceed with the sale of the assets, given the provisions of section 43(2) of the Public Corporations (Amendment) Act, 1993. But Mr Mselem has made a valid point that in actual fact the Commission enjoys wider powers than those vested in a receiver by the Ordinance.

      "Mr Fraser for the Appellant urged the view that for non-primary documents the parties to an appeal decide which documents they would want to use in the appeal and, accordingly, take appropriate steps to bring them on record. The trial courts notes whether or not either party considers them relevant and essential to the determination of the appeal, provided they were made before the decision appealed from, are primary documents and unless specifically excluded by a judges direction given under Rule 85(3) aforesaid, their omission from the record, as is the case here, render the appeal incompetent. Likewise all interlocutory applications and orders made pursuant thereto, and all exhibits, must be included in the record of appeal unless excluded as aforesaid. Besides, the enactment of Rule 89 does not confer on this Court the power to excuse the exclusion of any document from a record of appeal, but merely creates an opening for bringing on record, with the leave of the court, certain essential documents which, by an oversight or inadvertence, were excluded. There was debate as to whether certain bundles of documents, which were exchanged between counsel and which were put to witness who partly testified before the application for leave to amend the plaint was filed, and which the trial Judge might have looked at before granting the leave to amend, could be considered as exhibits within the meaning of Rule 85(1)( f ) of the Rules. Mr Fraser expressed the view that because the bundles were not formally tendered as exhibits, they should be disregarded, more so, he said, because they were not an agreed bundle or bundles. He cited the case of Dhanji v Malde Timber Company (supra) as authority for the proposition that unless documents are specifically put in evidence, they should not be looked at. In reply, Mr Gatonye submitted that as the trial Judge was given copies of those documents and he had an opportunity of looking at them, they might have influenced his decision. The bundles of documents in issue were among the documents the trial court had before it and it is possible that court relied on them to come to the decision appealed against. As both counsel in this mater were in agreement that the documents were given to the trial Judge, in support of the parties respective cases, they were in our view, exhibits and should have, therefore, formed part of the record of appeal, in absence of any direction in that regard under Rule 85(3) aforesaid.

Referring to Commissioner of General Income Tax v Power Limited [1970] EA 328 which stipulated that the verb manufacture may within certain limits, have different meanings according to the context in which it is used, but in almost every sense it must mean to produce something, she urged the court to find that power generation was a manufacturing process. In the Matter of an Application for a Patent by Henry Barnato Rartzen Patents Appeal Tribunal, United Kingdom and that it was goods (State Electricity Commission of Victoria v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA; and Quebec Hydro-Electric Commission v Deputy Minister of National Revenue) she argued the definition given to the word manufacture in the Act should be interpreted without more restriction other than that specified in it.\n",

      "This, counsel submitted, means that there was a mischief or lacuna which was not contemplated or envisaged at the time of enacting the subsection originally but which was noticed later and steps were promptly taken to remedy it. We go along with the view that while subsection (2)(b)(i) in its original form did not contemplate registration under sections 14 and 15 of Chapter 212, subsequently, and in the wake of the present case, it was realised or discovered that this left room for tax evasion, and that upon such discovery appropriate steps were taken promptly to remedy the situation by re-enacting the subsection in its amended form. In this regard the operative words of the subsection are upon payment of any amount, and our understanding of the provision is that the obligation to make the deduction, which is mandatory, attaches at the time of making the payment. We could see no room for Mr Kibutas submission that where, as in this case, payment is made to a foreign company which registers subsequently then the company is liable to pay corporation tax only. Before the trial court was an application for certiorari to remove to the High Court and quash the unlawful tax demands for the specific sum of money and the unlawful collection of that sum by the Commissioner of Income Tax. As we have amply demonstrated, the Commissioners demand for and collection of withholding tax were lawful only in respect of the first instalment of TShs 147 865 625 management fees paid to MBI on 31 May 1997 before the company was registered in the United Republic and became resident.\n",

      "Particulars of the appellants alleged negligence were stated in paragraphs 5 as: (a) Providing and bottling Miranda fruity and Miranda lemon with starchy substance suspended therein; (b) Failure to detect the said starchy substances; (c) Putting on the market the said sodas sealed with starchy substances; (d) Knowing that the said sodas would reach the plaintiff with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination; (e) Injuring the plaintiffs life as shown by Annexure B causing him a 60% permanent disability thus denying him enjoyment of his natural rights. The law is now well settled that an appellate court will not interfere with an award of damages by a trial court unless the trial court has acted upon a wrong principle of law or that the amount is so high or so low as to make it an entirely an erroneous estimate of the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled. The earliest authority on this point I have been able to find is Phillips v London South Western Point (supra), in which James LJ said on pages 85: The first point, which is a very important one, relates to dissenting from verdict of the jury upon a matter which generally speaking is considered to be within their exclusive province, that is to say the amount of damages: We agree that judges have no right to overrule the verdict of a jury as to the amount of damages, merely because they take a different view, and think that if they had been the jury, they would have given more or would have given less, still the verdict of juries as to the amount of damages are subject, and for the sake of justice, be subject, to supervision of a court of first instance and if necessary of a court of appeal in this way that is to say, if in the judgment of the court the damages are unreasonably large or are unreasonably small then the court is bound to send the matter for consideration by another jury. In Owen v Sykes [1936] 1 KB 192, the Court of Appeal of England felt that although if they had tried the case, in the first instance they would have probably awarded a smaller sum as damages yet they would not review the finding on damages as they were not satisfied that the trial judge acted upon a wrong principle of law, or that amount awarded as damages was so high as to make it an entirely erroneous estimate of the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled. This principle has been applied in East Africa and Uganda: see: Muljibhai v The Particular another (1944) EACA, Mitford Bowker (1947) 14 EACA 20; Watson v Powles [1968] IQ 596 and Obonyo v Municipal Council of Kisumu [1971] EA 91 of 96. In my opinion, the principle that an appellate court will not interfere with the award of damages by a trial court unless the trial court acted upon wrong principle of law or the amount awarded is so high or so low as to make it an entirely erroneous estimate of the damages to which the plaintiff was entitled equally applies to the instant case. It is trite law that the amount of general damages which a plaintiff may be awarded is a matter of discretion by the trial Court.\n",

      "It was for the respondent to prove that the Commissioner-General was wrong when he stated that he was satisfied that the use of a battery booster in a garage would not be for use solely or principally as industrial apparatus, plant or machinery. The word industrial must have a wider content and due to the defective definition in the Act it was permissible to adopt a dictionary meaning such as that given in Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary as covering systematic economic activity, or any branch thereof; a trade or manufacture. I think that the two Acts are part of the legislative structure regarding the imposition of and exemptions from import duties. I do not think that the respondent discharged the onus of proving that the Commissioner-General came to a wrong decision when he stated that he was satisfied that they were not an industrial item under Chapter 8501A of the First Schedule. Before leaving this appeal I would remark that the concession by Mr. Smith that he consulted the dictionary meaning of the word industrial should not have bound the magistrate in trying to arrive at a right decision on the facts by reference to the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act; and the fact that the Commissioner-General may have made an erroneous exemption relating to the previous importation of similar articles cannot create an estoppel against him: Tarmal Industries Ltd. v.

Consequently, the applicant has relied on rule 1(3) of the rules of this Court, which provides: 1(3) Nothing in these rules shall be taken to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court, and Court of Appeal to make such orders as may be necessary for achieving the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of any such court, and that power shall extend to setting aside judgments which have been proved null and void after they have been passed, and shall be exercised to prevent an abuse of the process of any court caused by delay. We have in mind: Ladd v Marshall [1954] 3 All ER 745 at 148 Skone v Skone [1971] 2 All ER 582 at 586; Langdale v Danby [1982] 3 All ER 129 at 137; Sadrudin Shariff v Tarlochan Singh [1961] EA 72, Elgood v Regian [1968] EA 274; American Express International v Atulkimar S Patel application number 8B of 1986 (SCU) (UR); Karmali v Lakhani [1958] EA 567 and Corbett [1953] 2 All ER 69. A summary of these authorities is that an appellate court may exercise its discretion to admit additional evidence only in exceptional circumstances, which include: \n",
      "(i) Discovery of new and important matters of evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within the knowledge of, or could not have been produced at the time of the suit or petition by, the party seeking to adduce the additional evidence;\n",
      "(ii) It must be evidence relevant to the issues;\n",
      "(iii) It must be evidence which is credible in the sense that it is capable of belief;\n",
      "(iv)  The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive;\n",
      "(v) The affidavit in support of an application to admit additional evidence should have attached to it, proof of the evidence sought to be given;\n",
      "(vi)The application to admit additional evidence must be brought without undue delay. We must stress that for the same reason, courts should be even more stringent to allow a party to adduce additional evidence to re-open a case, which has already been completed on appeal. The second was that in this case, the Constitutional Court had no jurisdiction to interpret Act 13 of 2000 because the Act had become part and parcel of the Constitution as all the constitutional procedural requirements for enacting it had been complied with counsel for the respondents, Mr GS Lule, opposed the objections. In the circumstances with due respect, we are unable to agree with the learned Solicitor Generals contention that it was the fault of Mr Dennis Bireije alone that evidence now sought to be admitted as additional evidence was not produced at the trial of the petition or at the appeal hearing. It is inconceivable that a petition and an appeal of this importance could have been left to the whims of, or to put it in the words of the learned Solicitor General, to the incompetence of one commissioner who, notwithstanding the judgment of him by the Solicitor General, had risen steadily in the promotional ranks of the Attorney-Generals chambers, presumably on merit. Further, the applicants case both in the Constitutional Court and on appeal to this Court having been handled, according to the record, by Dennis Bireije and other quite senior officers in the applicants chambers we would have expected Dennis Bireije or any one or more of the other officers who handled the petition and the appeal to have explained by affidavit why copies of the speakers certificate and of the Hansard were not produced as evidence at the hearing of the petition or as additional evidence on appeal to this Court.\n",

      "(1) of the section, where a tribunal is satisfied that the standard rent as fixed under that subsection would yield an uneconomic return because (in the absence of any indication that the purchase price paid by the landlord was excessive) it does not yield a fair capital return on the purchase price of the premises, the tribunal may determine the standard rent to be such amount as in all the circumstances of the case it considers to be fair. It is clear that in such a case it is in the interest of the tenant and not of the landlord that the purchase price paid for the premises should be shown to have been excessive and since the indication referred to is of a positive nature, namely, that the price was excessive, rather than of a negative nature to the effect that the price was not excessive, the burden of showing some indication as to the price having been excessive falls on the party who would benefit thereby, namely, the tenant. The criterion laid down for the purposes of that subsection is that the standard rent to be fixed thereunder should be such amount as, in all the circumstances of the case, the tribunal considers fair, and in my opinion the question of what is fair in the present case can properly be considered in the light of, among other things, the current return of income obtainable in Nairobi from other forms of investment in land including the placing of money on mortgage. Under s. 30 of the Act it is provided that a tribunal in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the Act shall have the same powers in civil matters as are conferred upon this court, including a power in its discretion to order any party to the proceedings to pay the whole or any part of the costs and either itself to fix the amount of such costs or to direct taxation by the taxing officer of the court either on the High Court scale or on the subordinate court scale. The appellants contention is, first, that the order for costs complained of was made solely because the tribunal was under the impression that the hearing before it had been adjourned several times on the application of the appellants, which it is said, was contrary to the facts; secondly, that the practice of tribunals under the Act in assessment cases is not to award any costs except where a landlords application is dismissed; and, thirdly, that costs, if awarded against a tenant, should not exceed Shs.\n",

      "They looked at The Rent Restriction Act, Megarry, 9th Edn., p. 114 and discovered that in his summary of the English cases he found that the court must be careful to ensure that the landlord does not evade the restrictions of the Act upon increases of rent by subdividing the tenancies or by making small alterations to the structure such as blocking up a connecting door or some minor improvements. The Tribunal then recalled that excess rent could not be recovered for the period 1 February to 30 November 1969 because that was outside the two years period prescribed by s. 19 (3) for the recovery of any sum paid by a tenant which s. 19 (1) said he could recover. I do not think, on the evidence before the Tribunal, the appellants could argue that successfully because they knew the father rented it for the respondent when he had qualified, but was not making his way with sufficient success to take on the rent of these premises and that later the son was able to pay the rent himself and the appellants accepted it from him. The Tribunal had jurisdiction or power to deal with excess rent to that extent, at any rate, under the Act and any proceedings dealing with those two points, had the tenant paid excess rent? There is no way in which the power to give judgment for sums paid in excess rents for tenants against landlords can be imported into the Act and the consequence is that the presumption remains that the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts is not displaced in any matter save by Parliaments express will.\n",

Notice of appeal was filed on his behalf presumably on his instructions, because it is my experience that advocates do not take steps involving the expenditure of money without receiving instructions. He is unable to put forward a single valid reason why he should have time extended at this late stage except his belief that the appeal has reasonable prospects of success. That is a factor for consideration in applications of this nature but the main factor, and the burden is on the applicant in this respect, is that the court must be satisfied that for some sufficient reason it was not possible for the appeal to be lodged in the time prescribed. There is absolutely no reason here shown to me why the appeal could not have been lodged in time and I would be failing in my duty if I were to give effect to the agreement between counsel.

      "Despite the fact that the hearing of the case took some 15 days, so we were informed, the evidence adduced was imprecise as it was not made clear whether the shuttering and the gum poles recovered by the plaintiff were included in the articles wrongfully detained by the defendant. Mr. Khanna for the respondent submitted that, in these circumstances, when the appellant prevented the respondent from completing the work under the contract on 3 April 1971, the nine months had expired and the respondent, who was not responsible for the delays which had occurred, was entitled to payment in full of the contract price. Assuming time to have been originally of the essence, it became at large because of extra work ordered by the appellant and the various delays caused by him, for which the respondent has been compensated. This is in my view a case of what is called, in Hudsons Building and Engineering Contracts, 9th ed., p. 450, prevention or wrongful termination of contract by the employer, in which case the builder is entitled by way of damages to the loss of profit he would otherwise have earned. The evidence adduced in this respect was unsatisfactory and imprecise, but the judge did the best he could on the material available to him, and although another judge might have awarded less, it has not been shown to my satisfaction that any interference with his awards is called for.\n",

      "624 the East African Court of Appeal held that a police officer was not entitled to claim privilege in respect of the facts upon which he had reached his conclusion that certain property had been stolen without the complicity of the defendant. This construction of the section probably led to the 1972 amendment; (b) if privilege is claimed the witness may be required by the court to explain the circumstances in which the privilege is claimed to enable the court to decide whether the public interest would suffer by the disclosure (per Newbold, P.) but (per Spry, J.A.) This gives a broad construction to this part of the section but I am satisfied that this must have been the intention of the legislature as to hold otherwise may lead to a complete denial of justice in cases in which the privilege claimed could not possibly come within the meaning of s. 132. It is clearly in the public interest, and not against it, that the police should assist the victims of traffic accidents in obtaining compensation arising out of negligent driving on public roads. It is not unusual for these civil claims to come to court some three years after the accident, in which case the evidence of the police officer who visited the scene and from his own observations made a sketch plan showing the position of the vehicles, marks on the road etc. Nor can I see any objection to police officers refreshing their memories from the police file of past events. 5 of the form of the abstract from a police record of an accident provides for the supplying of copies of witnesses statements with their consent and no privilege is claimed in respect of these statements. In my view Mohindras case has no application to the question of admissible police evidence of traffic accidents, if it has not in fact been overruled by the later Raichura case.\n",

      "Counsel for the objector has strongly attacked inter alia the taxing masters ruling that there is a practice to allow more than the basic instructions fee when a suit of this type is contested. While there would seem to be no legal sanction for it and of course every case must be dealt with on its own facts, a healthy and savoury practice which tends to enlighten advocates in regard to the possible costs which will be incurred in court ought not to be condemned provided it does not step outside the bounds of reasonableness. In my opinion the most that can be said is that the taxing master was somewhat, only slightly but not very much, generous in allowing an instructions fee of Shs. 2,000/- which by itself creates no justification for interference by this court with the taxing masters discretion. I cannot find anything in the rules which precludes witness expenses being allowed for a witness who has travelled from abroad to give evidence in the court in Kenya. The taxing master correctly appreciated that the witness was reasonably out of the jurisdiction of the court when his evidence was required and that he travelled from Ethiopia solely for the purpose of giving evidence at the trial and not for some other purpose. The taxing master further correctly appreciated that the evidence of Father De Marchi might have been recorded de bene esse or upon commission. In the circumstances of this case in my opinion the taxing master properly held that the personal attendance of this witness was reasonable and proper. In my opinion it is not necessary that there should be an express order made by the court to enable the expenses of a witness who has travelled from abroad to be claimed. A general order making an award of costs embraces such expenses; thereafter, it is for the taxing master to decide what reasonable amount is. It is not necessary that the court should specifically make an order allowing each individual item.\n",

      "The judgment debtor  First Defendant in this case  never paid the decretal amount and on 28 April 2003, this Court made an order for the attachment of the First Defendants six motor vehicles, which attachment was done on 19 June 2003 by Tip Top Auctioneers, in an effort to satisfy the above judgment and decree. Clause 18.1 of each of the hire-purchase agreements, states that the hire-purchase agreements shall automatically terminate upon a levy of execution against the hirer  the First Defendant  upon which event the hirers liability is to pay its indebtedness to the owner  the Objector. The success or failure of the Objectors application revolves around this simple, but critical question of law: Who has priority over the goods of a judgment debtor? A debenture creates a floating charge over the assets of the execution debtor, and such floating charge confers upon the debenture holder only equitable interest over the assets. Further, where there is a floating charge over the movable property of an execution debtor (as is the case here) created by a debenture, the floating charge crystallises on the date of the appointment of the receiver. As a matter of fact, and as stated earlier on, no receiver had been or has been appointed by the debenture holder (the Objector) in this case, at least as at the time of filing this application. Should a receiver have been appointed by the debenture holder after the execution by attachment complained of has been put in motion, the law is very clear. In the case of Kahagi v Kencity Clothing Limited [1982] KLR 464, it was held, at 465: If before the appointment of a receiver by a debenture holder the machinery of execution by attachment and sale has been put in motion by an execution creditor, then the execution creditor has priority over the debenture holder whose charge has not yet crystallised. At 466 of the same authority, there is no doubt that the execution creditors interest in the attached goods has a priority, and that priority is not lost if a receiver is appointed before the attached goods are sold, provided that the machinery of execution by attachment and sale preceded the appointment of the receiver. The above seems, in my view, to firmly seal the case in favour of the Plaintiff  execution creditor  and against the Applicant/Objector.\n",

      "The first innuendo alleged that by the words refer to drawer, the defendant meant and was understood to mean and imported to any who read them placed in that situation that the plaintiff has drawn a cheque upon account which it knew or ought to have known was not in credit to the amount of that cheque and he was unable to pay the amount of the cheque and that meant to a reasonable being that it was unsafe to give credit to him. When a banker dishonours a cheque and marks on it refer to drawer, he is indicating that the bank will not honour the cheque on the instant presentment and that the person who presented it and other persons concerned should get in contact with the person who made the cheque for any explanation required or in order to decide his further course of action. This procedure is usually adopted when the amount of credit or facilities arranged in respect of the particular account are not sufficient to enable the bank to pay the cheque at the time when the cheque was presented for payment. They do not indicate that there may not have been some reasonable, perfectly satisfactory and completely innocent explanation as regards the plaintiffs conduct as is the case in these two particular instances and no doubt in many other instances where those words are put on a dishonoured cheque. As regards the claim on the basis of breach of contract, it was argued for the defence that on the basis pleaded the contract to credit the account was only as between the bank and the plaintiffs employers and that there was no breach of any contract between the bank and the plaintiff and no claim laid on the basis of negligence. I think that in the contract of banker and customer as between the plaintiff and the defendant there was necessarily an implied term that the bank would be reasonably diligent and efficient in keeping the account, in applying to it all proper credits and honouring all cheques drawn on the account when it was in sufficient credit. If so I think the person concerned could be congratulated on his powers of deduction, but I do not think that the bank was necessarily bound to employ a man with knowledge that the suffix jit or jeet probably indicated a Sikh, in order that proper credits should be given to the plaintiffs account without further enquiry. Nor do I think that from the fact that an employee of the bank dealing with earlier transactions happened to know or discover that the credits were to go to the plaintiff, it necessarily follows that other employees of the bank dealing with a later credit should necessarily have the same knowledge or be able to deduce it. This is a matter which depends on circumstances, and in the present case I do not think that the circumstances establish negligence or breach of contract to the plaintiff on the part of the bank.\n",

Mr. Georgiadis has submitted that since the trial judge had found that the appellant had been made redundant, he should have equated redundancy with abolition of her office, in terms, so he submitted, of Treasury Circular 10 of 8 June 1963. If there was even some slight positive or factual evidence indicating that her post was abolished, I would have used the circumstantial evidence and the inferences which could be drawn therefrom to reinforce such evidence, and I would then have shifted the burden to the respondent to establish that the post was not abolished.

He argued that since the appellant had informed the court that when he committed the offence he was under the influence of alcohol that should have been taken as a mitigating factor when passing sentence. He argued further that as the appellant was remorseful and had pleaded guilty, a lesser sentence should have been imposed on him. In the instant appeal, before passing sentence the learned judge took into account all relevant mitigating and aggravating circumstances. He considered the facts that the appellant was a first offender, was repentant and had pleaded guilty. He also took into account the age of the victim which was only 6 years and the maximum penalty for the offence which is death. With due respect to counsel for the appellant, the leaned judge did not fail to take into account intoxication as a mitigating factor.

Where there has been a true accord, under which the creditor voluntarily agrees to accept a lesser sum in satisfaction and the debtor acts upon that accord by paying the lesser sum and the creditor accepts it, there it is inequitable for the creditor afterwards to insist on the balance, but he is not barred unless there has been truly an accord between them.

      "As indicated in the cases of Tanzania Cotton Marketing Board (supra) and Tanzania Electrical Supply Company and others v Independent Power Tanzania Limited consolidated civil applications numbers 10 and 22 of 1997 (UR) one of the factors to be considered in an application for stay of execution is whether the outcome of the appeal if successful would be rendered nugatory if execution is not stayed as urged by Mrs Makani. Dealing with this principle, in Tanzania Cotton Marketing Board v Cogecot Cotton Company SA [1997] TLR 63, this Court cited with approval the English case of Winchester Cigarret Machinery Limited v Payne and another (number 2) TLR 15 December 1993 wherein it was stated inter alia: In recent cases it has been said that the practice of the court had moved on from the principle that the only ground for a stay was the reasonable probability that damages and costs paid would not be repaid if the appeal succeeds. In Zacharia Barie Bura v Theresia Maria John Mubiru civil application number 10 of 1991 (UR) a case involving stay of an eviction order, a single judge of this Court inter alia stated: I am satisfied that it would be imprudent to have him and his family evicted while there is pending in this Court an appeal against the very decision sought to be used to evict him. Granting the application for stay of execution, the full court in part, stated: We think in a case like this one, where there is a notice of appeal against a problematic judgment, the interest of justice require a stay of execution to be granted pending the hearing and decision of the appeal so that the judgment of the High Court may be sorted out. Granting stay of execution would, in my opinion be in the interests of justice rather than carrying on the execution process pertaining the costs in which there is some uncertainty. Consequently, the High Court order of 23 August 2005 in miscellaneous case number 307 of 2002 is ordered to be stayed pending the determination of the intended appeal.\n",

      "And who desires a review of the decree passed or order made may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order without unreasonable delay: (a) upon the discovery of new and important matter or evidence, which after the exercise of due diligence was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or the order was made; (b) on the account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record; or (c) for other sufficient reason. In Purcell v FC Trigell [1970] 3 All ER 671, Winn LJ said at 676: It seems to me that, if a consent order is to be set aside, it can really only be set aside on grounds which would justify the setting aside of a contract entered into with knowledge of the material matters by legally competent persons, and I see no suggestion here that any matter that occurred would justify setting aside or rectification of this order looked as a contract. As to whether the charge was defective and therefore unenforceable, I find that the charge on the face of it clearly states that it was an instrument prepared in a manner approved by the Chief Land Registrar in terms of section 108 of the Registered Land Act. Indeed this is the legal position, for in the absence of such a chattels mortgage or a general debenture, the respondent has no legal basis for selling the said movable and therefore removable assets, on the footing that the land and other improvements on the suit property are adequate if sold at the best price in a forced sale and would satisfy the consent decree. The applicant therefore succeeds on this point, and the respondent is therefore restrained from advertising for sale, by public auction or private contract, the plant, equipment and machinery and other chattels currently installed in buildings stores or other facilities in the suit land and shall issue to the applicant written undertaking in terms that the respondent shall in advertisement of the suit land specifically exclude from such advertisement reference to the sale of the plant, machinery and any equipment and other chattels situate upon the suit land, and shall carry out such advertisement strictly in terms of and in conformity with the contract, charge instrument, decree and all statutory and legal provisions applicable to the intended sale.\n",

      "The husband now appeals to this court, on a certificate by the High Court that a point of law of general public importance is involved; that is, whether a husbands duty to maintain his wife subsists if the wife, without good cause, deserts the matrimonial home. Except where the parties are separated by agreement or by decree of the court and subject to any subsisting order of the court ( a) i t shall be the duty of every husband to maintain his wife or wives and to provide them with such accommodation, clothing and food as may be reasonable having regard to his means and station in life;. Mr. Lubuva, who appeared for the Attorney-General as amicus curiae and to whom we are grateful for his assistance, submitted that while, on a strict interpretation of s. 63, the wife would appear entitled to maintenance, the court ought to take a broader view and look generally to the intention of the legislature. It is true that in the absence of an agreement for separation or of a decree of a court, a husband is under a duty to maintain his wife but the normal way a husband maintains his wife is basically by providing a home, food and clothes. I should perhaps add that while, at first sight, it might appear from the wording of paragraph (a) of s. 63, that the provision of accommodation, clothing and food is distinct from and additional to the maintaining of a wife, on a closer analysis, it is, I think, clear that what the paragraph means is that it is the duty of a husband to maintain his wife and that in maintaining her, the standard of accommodation, clothing and food must be reasonable. I think, with respect, that the judge was wrong and I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore that of the District Court. The husband did not apply for costs, and in the circumstances we make no order for costs of the appeal.\n",

      "The Learned trial Judge after evaluating that evidence and the further evidence that the drums which were stolen were heavy, and that each of them needed more than three men to load onto a lorry, came to the conclusion that the loading must have taken quite a long time, a fact which would not have escaped the attention of the guard on duty. He surmised that the Respondents guard must have been absent when the burglary took place, otherwise he would have triggered the distress alarm or shouted for help. It is trite law, and the provisions of Order XIV of the Civil Procedure Rules are clear, that issues for determination in a suit generally flow from the pleadings, and unless pleadings are amended in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules, the trial court, by dint of the provisions of Order XX, Rule 4 of the aforesaid Rules, may only pronounce judgment on the issues arising from the pleadings or such issue as the parties have framed for the courts determination. Otherwise, to decide against a party on matters which do not come within the issues arising from the dispute as pleaded clearly amounts to an error on the face of the record. None of those issues related to the possibility of the Respondents guard being absent from the Appellants factory on the material night of the burglary and theft in that factory. The Appellants case as pleaded was, as rightly pointed out by the trial Judge, based on alleged negligence on the part of the Respondents employees and the particulars in that regard were that he failed to exercise due care, or remain alert, failing to warn or give any alarm of burglary, or to prevent it or to notice those who committed the burglary. That being so, and the Appellant having not based its case on fundamental breach of the contract of service between the parties, it is our judgment that the Learned trial Judge, quite properly came to the conclusion that the guard or guards were either passively or actively involved in the burglary and theft which gave rise to this suit.\n",
