Editors Summary

The appellant sued the respondent for possession of premises occupied by him. There was an agreement for a lease for 5 years and 1 month which was not registered. The trial judge held that as the agreement between the parties was unregistered it must be deemed to have resulted in a lease from month to month. On appeal

Held 

(i) an agreement for a lease is a document creating a right to obtain another document and so is exempted from the requirement of registration;

( ii) an agreement for a lease for more than 12 months is valid between the parties although it gives no protection against the rights of third parties (Figueiredo & Co. v. Moorings Hotel (2) and Clarke v.

Sondhi (3) considered);

(iii) as there was a contract which could have been specifically enforced, there was an agreement to the contrary for the purpose of s. 106 of the Indian Transfer of Property Act 1882;

(iv) the respondent held under the same terms as if a lease had been granted (Walsh v. Lonsdale (1) followed).

Appeal allowed.
