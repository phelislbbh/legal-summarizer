Mbogoro v Oc-Cid Songea District and another  Division: Court of Appeal of Tanzania at Mbeya  Date of judgment: 2 June 2004  Case Number: 44/04  Before: Ramadhani, Nsekela and Msoffe JJA  Sourced by: Lawafrica  [1] Civil procedure  Court of Appeal Rules  Meaning of deputy registrar with whom to lodge notice of  appeal  Effect of not signing notice of appeal.  Editors Summary  The appellant sued the respondents for general damages of TShs 100 million for wrongful confinement.  However, he was awarded TShs 20 000 as contemptuous damages and he appealed.  The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the notice of appeal was defective as it was lodged in the sub-registry of the High Court of Tanzania instead of lodging it with the registrar of the High Court and that it also showed that it was to be sent to the deputy registrar of the High Court, instead of being sent to the registrar of the High Court.     Held  While it is true that under rule 2 registrar of the High Court means the registrar of the High Court and includes a district and deputy registrar of that court, the deputy registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot be a registrar of the High Court. It was therefore wrong to send and lodge the notice with the deputy registrar of the Court of Appeal at Songea. Since the notice was not signed by the appellant or his advocate as prescribed under Form D, there was no notice of appeal filed with the court. Appeal struck off.
