Editors Summary  The plaintiffs sued the defendant in negligence and nuisance for damages suffered by fire.  The facts are set out in the judgment.  For the plaintiffs, it was contended that the defendants driver had been negligent in parking off the road, that the covers of the tanker had not been adequately fastened, that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied and that a nuisance had been created.  For the defendant, it was contended that the driver had taken proper care, that the plaintiffs were the authors of their own misfortune in approaching a situation of danger, that the chain of causation was broken by the fire having been deliberately started and that there was no nuisance as risk could not have been foreseen.  Held   (i) The driver was not negligent in driving the tanker off the road;  ( ii) the fire was caused by the deliberate act of a person for whom the defendant was not responsible;  (iii) The chain of causation was broken by this independent act;  (iv) The plaintiffs were the authors of their own misfortune by deliberately exposing themselves to the danger of fire;  (v) There was no foreseeability of risk and accordingly no nuisance created.
