BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

FACTS
After receiving an assessment from the respondent he filed an application for review before the Tax Appeals Tribunal. The application was received and is recorded as TAT No. 22 of 2006. The said application unfortunately cannot be heard immediately as the Tax Appeals Tribunal has no members for the moment.

ISSUES
 whether the respondent can be barred by way of injection from enforcing the agency notices issued, and from issuing further agency notices in respect of the tax demanded from the applicant until the Tax Appeals Tribunal has offered ruling

HELD
Court held that the applicant had not in anyway indicated that minus the injection, he is likely to suffer irreparable damage that cant be compensated with normal damages thus the application was dismissed
