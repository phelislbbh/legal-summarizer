Editors Summary  The plaintiff sued the defendant seeking an order compelling the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff 31 pallets of tin plates, damages, interest on damages and costs. The defendant filed a defence counterclaim seeking a declaration that it had a lien over the said pallets and further sought an order compelling the plaintiff to pay the defendants charges in default the defendant be at liberty to sell the said pallets to recover its charges.  The parties agreed on issues for determination as follows:  (i) Whether the defendant was put on election between suing the plaintiff for charges or retaining the plaintiffs cargo in exercise of its lien.  (ii) Whether by instituting High Court civil case number 689 of 1998 the defendant had lost its right of lien.  Held  The defendant was not put on election between suing the plaintiff for charges or retaining the plaintiffs cargo in exercise of its lien because the filing of the High Court Suit was consistent with the defendants lien on the cargo. By instituting the High Court Case the defendant in the present case did not lose its right of lien over the plaintiffs cargo. Suit dismissed, counterclaim allowed with costs.
