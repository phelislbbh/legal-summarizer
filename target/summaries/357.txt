Editors Summary  The plaintiff was the principal Judge in charge of the High Court. An article appeared in the defendants  publication which referred to a case he had handled in which he allegedly failed to apply equal speed in  granting bail to two persons charged jointly with an offence of abuse of office. The article imputed a  corrupt  Page 235 of [2004] 2 EA 234 (HCU)  motive to the plaintiff. The defendants publication failed to publish an apology when formally  contacted, and instead responded that it would call as a witness the Chief Justice in the threatened libel  case. The plaintiff testified that he was greatly defamed by the said article, that his reputation had been  severely damaged and that he was entitled to an award of damages.  The defence denied that the publication in question was defamatory, and in the alternative pleaded  fair comment.  Held  Under the law, a man is entitled to his good reputation. Scott v Sampson [1882] 8 QBD 203  adopted. If a defamatory statement is made in a written publication, a tort of libel is committed for which  damages are awardable. Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 adopted. For a statement to be defamatory, it  must be false and must lower the plaintiff in the estimation of the reasonable reader. Astaire v Campling  [1966] 1 WLR 34 adopted. The plaintiff has the burden to prove that the words complained of are  defamatory. If the words are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning, the plaintiff only needs to  prove publication. The plaintiff in this case had testified and proven the publication and the injury to his  reputation. The burden then shifted to the defendant who failed to call any witnesses and had therefore  failed to show that the words did not import a defamatory meaning.  The question of whether the words complained of were capable of conveying a defamatory meaning  was a question of law. The Court was not bound to accept the evidence or opinions of witnesses but must  make its own finding on the ordinary meaning of the words, and whether a reasonable man would be  likely to understand the words in a defamatory sense. In this case, the Court would hold that the words  complained of did contain defamatory matter.  To succeed in a defence of fair comment, the defendant must show that the words are comment and  not a statement of fact, that there is a basis of fact (which is true) for the comment complained of and that  the comment is on a matter of legitimate public interest.  Libel is a wrong actionable per se and the plaintiff need not prove actual damage. In this case, the  plaintiff went ahead and showed the devastating effect the publication had on him physically and  psychologically. The plaintiff would be entitled to general damages, such sum as would be sufficient to  compensate for the damage to his reputation, vindicate his good name and take account of the distress,  hurt and humiliation which the defamatory publication has caused. In determining the measure of  damages, the Court would look at awards in related libel cases. The Court would also consider the nature  of the libel, the extent of the publication, the conduct of the defendant (including whether an apology was  offered) before and after the publication and during the hearing. In view of the conduct of the defendant  herein and the other factors considered, an award would be made for general and aggravated damages  under one head of UShs 30 million.  Exemplary damages would be awarded where an award of general and aggravated damages was not  sufficient, in view of the need to teach the wrongdoer a lesson. To obtain exemplary damages, a plaintiff  must show that the publication was carried on for profit, that it was done with reckless disregard of the  law or with knowledge of its illegality, and that it was done because the prospects of  Page 236 of [2004] 2 EA 234 (HCU)  material advantage outweighed the prospects of material loss. In this case, the award of compensatory  damages would be sufficient to deter the defendant, and there would be no award of a further sum as  punitive damages.  Judgment given for the sum of UShs 30 million as compensatory damages (inclusive of exemplary  damages), a permanent injunction against future defamatory publication, interest and costs.
