Editors Summary

The applicant filed a constitutional matter as a direct reference, under sections 65, 77(1), 77(2) and 84(1) of the constitution of Kenya. The applicant was challenging the constitutionality of the Anti-Corruption Court to which he had been charged with a number of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act (Chapter 65) Laws of Kenya. The DPP contended that the application was bad in law as it did not comply with the procedure set out by the rules made under section 84(6) of the Constitution ie the Constitution of Kenya, Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms of the Individual Practice and Procedure Rules of 2001, Legal Notice number 133 of 2001. He averred that the application being in the manner of a constitutional reference was made directly to the High Court without regard to the procedure set out by the rules made pursuant to section 84(6) as read with section 84(1) of the constitution. The applicant had not first applied to the subordinate court where his trial was being heard before making the reference to the High Court. The applicant countered the preliminary objection on four grounds; that in interpreting constitutional matters, courts should do so liberally and give it the widest possible interpretation, more so in questions regarding fundamental rights; that section 84(1) and (3) of the constitution confers on an applicant unlimited right of access to the constitutional Court viz High Court; that the rules made under Legal Notice number 133 of 2001 were unconstitutional to the extent that they attempt to derogate from the applicants right of access to the High Court; and that the nature of the matter before the Court was such that it could not be determined by a preliminary objection and the applicant ought to be allowed to canvass his application fully and that it be determined on its merit. 



Held  Matters of fundamental rights and alleged violations of those rights were serious issues and the provisions relating to fundamental rights were meant to assure the citizens to come before the High Court unhesitantly and without any constraint. Kuria wa Gathoni and another v Attorney-General High Court miscellaneous application number 1384 of 2001.
