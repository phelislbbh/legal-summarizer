Editors Summary

The Appellant, a 16-year-old, was charged with the offence of murder in the High Court. He pleaded charge is true to a lesser charge of manslaughter. The plea was recorded and the particulars of the offence were read. He admitted the particulars, although there were material contradictions therein as to the date when the offence actually took place. After mitigation, he was sentenced to detention at the Presidents pleasure. The Appellant appealed claiming that the plea taking was irregular, and that the contradictions in the particulars of the charge rendered the conviction a nullity. It was also contended that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the offence as the proper venue of the trial was the Magistrates Court. In the alternative, the Appellant attacked the sentence, claiming that it was wrongly given on the assumption that the accused had been convicted of a capital offence. On appeal. 



Held The accused was represented by counsel, and his plea was unequivocal. He did not have a defence to the charge. Hence, the irregularities in taking of the plea and the contradictions in the particulars were irregularities in form and not in substance. They were curable under section 382 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Adan v Republic [1973] EA 445 applied). The High Court has constitutional unlimited original jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters. Its jurisdiction could not be held to have been ousted by any Act of Parliament. The sentence of detention at the Presidents pleasure could only have been pronounced where the accused was a child offender who had been convicted of a capital offence. As the accused in this case had not been convicted of murder, the sentence was erroneous. The Court of Appeal would be guided by the sentencing provisions of the Childrens Act in determining the proper sentence for the accused.
