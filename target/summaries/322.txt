Editors Summary  The appellants were tried and convicted by the High Court on a charge of murder contrary to sections 183 and 184 of the Penal Code Act. Their appeals to the Court of Appeal were dismissed. They now appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal erred in failing to adequately address the appellants defences of alibi, that it failed to properly re-evaluate the defence evidence as a whole and that it erred in holding that there was a common intention between the appellants. Counsel for the respondent supported the convictions of the appellants and argued that there was sufficient evidence to convict the appellants.     Held  The Court of Appeal rightly found that the trial court had erred in failing to consider the defences of alibi and the issue of grudge. However, the Court had dealt with the two issues and, having scrutinised the evidence as a whole, found that there was no merit in the allegation of grudge and that the prosecution had disproved the alibis. The Court of Appeal had correctly resolved all the relevant issues and rightly upheld the convictions. Appeal dismissed. However, confirmation of the death sentences would be postponed until the determination of the appeal in Zahura v Uganda [2004] LLR 436 (SCU) followed.
