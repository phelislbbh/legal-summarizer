Editors Summary The appellant agreed with government for the grant of a casino licence in Nairobi for 15 years. At the expiry of the 15 years the land and buildings would revert to government. The appellant claimed to deduct from its income for tax purposes a proportion of the cost of the land and buildings, arguing that the sole purpose of expenditure thereon was the earning of income, and that the agreement to surrender at the end of the term meant that the land and buildings did not constitute a capital asset. The appellant had asked the Commissioner-General to allow a special depreciation allowance under s. 141 and had been told that the section only allowed a decision not to assess or recover tax. On the appellants appeal the respondent contended that the decision could not be challenged in any court.

 Held  (i) the land and buildings were a capital asset; ( ii) the surrender would constitute a loss, diminution or exhaustion of capital; (iii) the question whether the Commissioner-General has the power to act under s. 141 can be decided by the court; it is only a decision actually made under the section which cannot be challenged; (iv) there is power only to refrain from assessing or recovering tax, and not to grant allowances or to vary or reduce assessments. Appeal dismissed.
