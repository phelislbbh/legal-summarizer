Editors Summary  On 17 September 1997 the Appellants agent sold the suit property by public auction in exercise of the  Appellants statutory power of sale. The Respondent was the highest bidder at KShs 3 200 000 and the  property was knocked down to them on condition that the Respondent would immediately pay 25% of the  sale price and the balance to the Appellant within 30 days from the date of sale. The Respondent paid the  25% deposit and agreed to pay the balance of KShs 2 400 000 within 30 days.  Six days later the Respondent wrote to the Appellant informing the Appellant inter alia that they  needed 60 days to arrange to pay the balance. The Appellant rejected this suggestion by the Respondent.  There was a subsequent meeting between the Appellant and the Respondent. After the meeting, the  Respondent wrote to the Appellant stating that the Respondent would pay the balance within 30 days of  receiving from the Appellants documents of title, discharge of charge and a duly executed transfer and  that the period of 30 days would be extended by consent and on good grounds. The Appellants reacted to  the said letter by refunding to the Respondents the 25% deposit.  Consequently, the Respondents filed suit in the High Court for breach of contract and other liquidated  sum. The Appellant filed a defence, the main basis of which was that the Respondent had made a counter  offer which was unacceptable to the Appellant hence the earlier offer to the Respondent had lapsed.  On 4 June, 1999 the Respondent applied for summary judgment under Order 35 Rules 1(1), 2 and 3 of  the Civil Procedure Rules and for the defence to be struck out under Order 6 Rule 13(1)(c) of the said  Rules for the reason that it might prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action. The High Court  gave summary judgment and struck out the defence, giving rise to this appeal.  Page 76 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  Held  The correspondence between the Appellant and the Respondent after the public auction of the  suit property seemed to vary the conditions of the original offer. There was an issue as to whether that  amounted to a counter-offer the non-acceptance of which terminated the original offer.  Unless the matter is plain and obvious, a party to a civil litigation is not to be deprived of his right to  have his case tried by a proper trial. Wenlock v Moloney and others [1965] 1WLR 1238 followed.  Summary procedure is applied to enable a Plaintiff to obtain quick judgment where there is plainly no  defence. Where the defence is a point of law and the court can see at once that the point is misconceived  or, if arguable, plainly unsustainable, summary judgment will be given. Summary procedure should not  be used for obtaining an immediate trial; the question must be short and dependent on few documents;  Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) [1990] 1 WLR  153 and Balli Trading v Afalona Shipping The Coral [1993] 1 Lloyds Rep 1 followed.
