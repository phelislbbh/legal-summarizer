Editors Summary  In this case the Court, of its own motion struck out the Appeal, as it was incurably incompetent for three different reasons: There was an ambiguity in the order appealed from, as the date mentioned therein differed from the date on which the ruling was in fact appealled from. An ambiguity in a primary document like an order is fatal. Anjumani v Ali [1998] LLR 868 (CAK) applied. The formal order included in the record of appeal was incurably defective as it was not prepared in a like manner as a decree as required by Order 20, Rules 6(1) and 7 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Two share certificates which formed part of the pleadings in the application before the Superior Court were in Spanish and contrary to rule 85(1)(f) of the Court of Appeal rules. There were no certified translations of the said certificates and hence the record was fatally defective. Appeal struck out.
