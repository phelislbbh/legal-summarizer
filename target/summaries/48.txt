Editors Summary  The Applicant and the Respondent were parties to a suit in the High Court. The suit gave rise to an interlocutory appeal which was determined by the Supreme Court in favour of the Respondent. The  Respondent filed a bill of costs before the Registrar for taxation. The Applicant complained that the taxed amount was excessive and filed reference for review of some items in the bill under Rule 105(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (the rules).  Pending the disposal of the reference, the Applicant made an application for stay of execution under  Rule 1(3) of the Rules on the grounds, inter alia, that the Respondent had no assets in Uganda, the reference would be rendered nugatory if execution proceeded and the Applicant was willing to provide security for costs.  The advocate for the Respondent raised three preliminary points of objection: first, the Applicant did not annexe to the application a copy of the ruling of the registrar, second, the application had been brought under Rule 1(3) of the Rules instead of Rule 5 and third, the affidavit supporting the application was defective because it did not distinguish matters sworn on information and matters sworn on own knowledge.  Held  It was not necessary to annexe a copy of the ruling of the registrar because there was no appeal pending before the Court. The merits of the reference would not influence the decision of the Court in dealing with the application for stay; Barclays Bank (U) Ltd v Mubiru (SC) civil application 1997and  JWR Kazzora v M L S Rukuba (SC) civil application number 4 of 1991 explained. Kampala Bottlers Ltd v  Uganda Bottlers Ltd civil application number 25 of 1995 cited with approval. Rule 5 applied where stay was sought pending appeal. There was no appeal pending and Rule 1(3) was rightly invoked. The affidavit supporting the application was sworn on the Applicants own knowledge.  The circumstances of the application justified a stay of execution and the same was granted. Kampala Bottlers v Uganda Bottlers Ltd (supra) followed.
