IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGANDA AT KAMPALA 
(COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION)

HCT-00-CC-MA-0916 OF 2004
(Arising from HCT-00-CC-CS-0877-2004)
CENTURY ENTERPRISES LTD::::::::::: APPLICANT/DEFENDANT
VERSUS
GREENLAND BANK (IN LIQUIDATION)::::::::::::::::: RESPONDENT/PLAINTIFF

 The Respondent herein filed HCCS No. 877/2004 to recover a sum of Shs.12, 778,645-, interest and costs of the suit. It is claimed that the Defendant in that case operated an account with the Plaintiff bank (now in liquidation). That in February 1998, the Defendant was granted an overdraft facility of Shs.5m and in March 1998 another one of Shs.3m. That at the time of the closure of the bank in 1999, the outstanding balance on the Defendants A/C was Shs.5, 862,959-. Hence the claim of Shs.12, 778,645- which includes interest up to the date of filing.
The applicant invited court to strike out the application for the respondent for leave to appear and defend because the Notice of Motion issued on 8/12/2004 and served on 3/2/2005 was out of time. The issue at court as whether there are substantive grounds to overshadow the procedural lapse.
Held: Court was hesitant to allow this procedural lapse to over shadow the substantive concerns of the Applicant. In the spirit of Article 126 (2) (e) of the constitution, it was inclined to disregard the irregularity. While there is, on the one hand, the necessity for the rules to be followed, there is, on the other hand, the need for the Courts to control their proceedings and not to be unreasonably inhibited by the rules of procedure. The idea is that the administration of justice should normally require that the substance of all disputes be investigated and decided on their merits, and that errors and lapses should not necessarily debar a litigant from the pursuit of his rights. Point of law accepted in part and applicant granted leave to defend the suit as prayed and the respondent awarded costs.
