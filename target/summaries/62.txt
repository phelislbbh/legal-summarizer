Case Number: 74/05

Case Number: 74/05

Before: Githinji, Waki JJA and Deverell AJA

Sourced by: LawAfrica

[1] Judicial review  Application for certiorari and prohibition  Appeal against dismissal of an

application for prohibition and certiorari  Factors for the court to consider.

Editors Summary

The applicants filed a judicial review application in the High Court seeking orders for prohibition and certiorari remedies to prohibit the prosecution from proceeding with their intended prosecution and quashing the charge sheet brought under section 129 of the Penal Code.

The judicial review application was dismissed and the applicants filed a notice of appeal.

Subsequently, they filed this application seeking a stay.

Held  If the appeal is allowed and the charge sheets and the convictions, if any, are quashed, the appeal will be nugatory since, irrespective of the result of the criminal proceedings, the applicants will have been forced to undergo anxiety and adverse publicity that inevitably flows from being tried for a criminal offence.

It is necessary for the applicants to satisfy the court that the intended appeals are not frivolous or are arguable.

At this stage of an application to stay criminal proceedings it is not for the court to make a final determination; it only needs to be satisfied that a sole bona fide contention is not unarguable or frivolous.

Application allowed.
