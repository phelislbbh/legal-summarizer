FACTS
Applicants were instructed Tumusiime, Kabega n Co Advocates to represent them in a court battle against the NSSF.

ISSUE
The agreed upon issue was to determine which firm was rightfully representing the ALCON INTERNATIONAL
Whether one of the company directors could withdraw instructions from earlier firm
