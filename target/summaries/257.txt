Editors Summary  The Applicant, LZ Engineering Construction Limited (L), applied to have Trade Bank Limiteds notice of appeal struck out on the ground that the time to lodge a record of appeal had expired. Trade Bank Limited (T) on lodging the notice of appeal, had written a letter to the registrar requesting certified copies of proceedings and ruling. L obtained a typed but uncertified copy of the proceedings and served the same on Ts advocates. Ts advocates however continued to await a certified copy of the proceedings. L filed the instant application arguing that the time to file the record of appeal had expired after T had obtained the typed proceedings but failed to act on them.     Held  The Appellant was wrong in asking for a certified copy of proceedings. A typed copy is sufficient. Hence the time taken to acquire a certified copy of the proceedings would not be included in the reckoning of time to lodge the notice of appeal. This time had already expired.
