Editors Summary  The Appellant was a registered co-owner of an immovable property. His co-owner sued the Appellant successfully and an order was issued for the sale of the immovable property. The Respondent, who was a court broker, was given the attachment warrant to attach and sell and he attached and sold the property.  The Appellant successfully challenged the decision to sue in the High Court but upon re-entering the property, he found that all his immovable property had been sold, stolen or vandalised.  The Appellant sued the Respondent for general and special damages arguing that by selling the  Appellants movable property, the Respondent had exceeded his powers given by the warrant of attachment and his conduct amounted to conversion. The Respondents advocate raised a preliminary objection urging that the plaint disclosed no cause of action on the grounds that the Respondent acted lawfully and as a court broker he was protected by section 48 of the Judicature Statute. He prayed that the plaint be dismissed under Order 7, Rule 11(a) and (b) of the Civil Procedure Rules. The Learned Judge upheld the objection and the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Held  In an objection to the plaint under Order 7, Rule 11(a) of the Civil Procedure Rules the judge had to obsence and construe the plaint carefully and see whether there was inherent defect in the plaint. A distinction must be drawn between an application to reject a plaint and one where a matter of law was set down for argument as a preliminary point. Under Order 7, Rule 11(a) of the Rules, an inherent defect in the plaint must be shown, rather than that the suit was not maintainable in law. In the latter case a preliminary point should be set down per hearing on a matter of law. Wycliffe Kigundu v Attorney-General (Supreme Court) civil appeal number 3 of 1993 (UR) and Nurdin Ali Dewji and others v Maghji and others [1953] 20 EACA 132 followed.  Whenever a court bailiff as a court officer was protected from suit for any lawful or authorised act done in the execution of a warrant under section 48(2) of the Judicature Statute, the protection was available only when the bailiff acted lawfully; Maria Onyango Ochola v W Hannington Wasswa [1988-1999] HCB 102 followed. The Appellants contention that the Respondent sold some immovable property without authority should have been investigated by way of evidence. The issue of protection under section 48(2) of the Judicature Statute was a point of law suitable for investigation at a full hearing.  The appeal was allowed.
