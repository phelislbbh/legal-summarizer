Editors Summary

The plaintiff claimed to have bought land from the first defendant in 1957 and to have been in occupation of it as owner ever since. The second defendant who was then a minor claimed to have bought the land from the first defendant and to have been registered as its proprietor under the Registered Land Act (Cap. 300) in 1959. The plaintiff prayed for a declaration that he had acquired title to the land by prescription, that the second defendant held the land on trust for him and should transfer it.

Held 

(i) on payment of purchase price by a purchaser in occupation his occupation becomes adverse to that

of the vendor (Bridges v. Mees (1) followed);

( ii) the plaintiff had been in possession of the land as owner for over twelve years;

(iii) the title to the land was a first registration and could not be rectified;

(iv) the period of limitation was not extended by the minority of the second defendant as the right of

action first accrued to the first defendant who was not under a disability;

(v) on first registration land is subject to prescriptive rights in the process of being acquired;

(vi) at the expiry of the prescription period the registered owner holds the land in trust for the person

who has prescribed ownership.
