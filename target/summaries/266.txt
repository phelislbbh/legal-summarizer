Mariaria and others v Matundura  Division: Court of Appeal of Kenya at Kisumu  Date of ruling: 26 March 2004  Case Number: 301/03  Before: OKubasu JA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: C Kanjama  [1] Appeal  Time  Extension of time  Delay of three and a half months  Delay attributable to  applicants previous counsel  Whether extension of time would be granted  Rule 4 Court of Appeal  Rules.  Editors Summary  The applicant filed an application seeking extension of time to file a notice and record of appeal. It was  claimed that the delay was due to missing documents which were not traced in time by the applicants previous counsel. The respondent urged the Court not to accommodate the carelessness of counsel, and also argued that the abandonment of the prayer for extension of time to file notice of appeal rendered the application defective.     Held  The decision whether or not to extend time for appealing is essentially discretionary. The Court will take into account (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the chances of the appeal succeeding if the application is granted, and (4) the degree of prejudice to the respondent if the application is granted. A three month delay without proper explanation like in the current case was inordinate. The litigant in such a case can claim damages from his advocate. The application would therefore be dismissed with costs.
