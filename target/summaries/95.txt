Editors Summary The respondent sued the appellant in the High Court for breach of a subcontract agreement in respect of the construction of a 26 kilometres road. The respondent claimed for general damages for breach of contract and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from making recourse to a performance bond and an advance payment bond under the contract. The appellant entered appearance and filed an application under section 6(1)(a), (b) and (2) of the Arbitration Act seeking a stay of proceedings pending reference to arbitration in terms of an arbitration clause contained in the contract between the parties. The application was granted by the Court. However, subsequently thereafter, the appellant instituted two suits High Court civil case number 466 and 467 of 1999 against Stallion Insurance Company Limited (the Insurance Company) claiming various sums of money in respect of local and foreign portions guaranteed under the performance bond and advance payment bond. The respondent filed an application seeking review of the orders made staying the suit and referring the dispute to arbitration, on the ground that since obtaining the orders, the appellant had instituted two other suits which form the crux of the claim in the present suit and that by filing the said two suits the appellant had exhibited lack of bona fides as it cannot approbate and reprobate. The appellant contended that the two subsequent suits related to contracts of suretyship between it and a third party (the Insurance Company) and that the contracts created their own obligations and causes of action independent of the dispute between the appellant and the respondent. The Learned Judge held that by filing the two subsequent suits, the appellant had in effect by conduct waived their rights to rely on the arbitration clause in the subcontract as to allow them to exploit the same right would mean their making recourse to the same performance bond and the same advance payment bond in the normal courts of law while in this case the proceedings were stayed to await arbitration. He found that it would be unfair and unjust to allow such a situation and proceeded to review his order staying the suit awaiting arbitration. The appellant was dissatisfied and appealed to the Court of Appeal. 



Held  The act by the appellant of subsequently filing other suits can clearly be construed to mean that it was no longer ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. It was not desirable to maintain two disparate tribunals (the Court and the arbitration) concurrently determining multiple suits with the same facts and law.
