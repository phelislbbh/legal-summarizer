Matembe and others v Attorney-General  Division: Constitutional Court of Uganda at Kampala  Date of judgment: 2005  Case Number: 1/05  Before: Okello, Engwau, Kitumba, Byamugisha and Kavuma JJA  Sourced by: Lawafrica  [1] Constitutional law  Doctrine of separation of powers  Power of Judiciary to inquire into the  actions of the Executive and the Legislature  Unconstitutionality of a Bill of Parliament.  [2] Temporary injunctions  Applicable principles in applications for temporary injunction.  Editors Summary  The applicants, all members of Parliament, filed this application seeking to restrain Parliament and its committees from further consideration of the Constitutional (Amendment) Bill number 2 of 2005 until final determination of Constitutional Petition number 2 of 2005 challenging the Bills constitutionality.     Held  In order to get a temporary injunction the applicant must show that there is a prima facie case with a probability to succeed; the applicant might suffer irreparable injury if the temporary relief is not granted; if the court is in doubt, it will decide the case on a balance of convenience. (Giella v Casman Brown and Co Ltd [1973] EA 358; Uganda Law Society and another v Attorney-General Constitutional application number 7 of 2003 applied). The doctrine of separation of powers is fundamental (Marbury v Madison 1 Cr 137 [180]; Uganda v Commissioner of Prisons Ex Parte Matovu [1966] EA 514 followed). However, this doctrine is not absolute. The Constitutional Court was established to guard the rights and freedoms of the individual against oppressive and unjust laws and acts and it must remain vigilant in upholding the provisions of the Constitution. If an allegation is made against the Executive or the Legislature about the unconstitutionality of their actions or omissions, the court is seized with jurisdiction to act. The Bill was tabled before Parliament and later to the Legal and Parliamentary Committee for its consideration. Until the Committee submits the report it is difficult to say that Parliament has accepted the Bill. Hence, it is premature to gauge a breach of the Constitution on the part of Parliament. Application dismissed.
