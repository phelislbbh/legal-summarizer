Editors Summary  The Appellants filed suit against the Respondent seeking damages for injuries sustained in an accident allegedly caused by the Respondents negligence. The suit was set down for hearing on 18 and 19 May  1999. When the suit came up for hearing on 18 May, counsel for the Appellants requested the court to adjourn the matter, following the Appellants testimony, to the following day. This was to enable the authors of the medical documents being relied on by the Appellants to come and give their testimony since the parties had not been able to agree on the documents to be produced in evidence. The  Respondent opposed the application which was duly denied by the judge. The First Appellant then gave evidence describing how the accident occurred and produced, without objection, various documents including medical reports on the injuries suffered by himself and his son, the Second Appellant. The  Second Appellant also gave unchallenged evidence describing, inter alia, the injuries he suffered in the accident. The trial Judge found the Respondent wholly liable for the accident but failed to award any damages on the ground that the Appellants had failed to call the doctors to give evidence. The Appellants appealed primarily on the ground that the trial Judge erred in failing to grant them the adjournment sought.  Held  A Court of Appeal should not interfere with a trial Judges exercise of discretion unless it is satisfied that the judge misdirected himself and as a result arrived at a wrong decision or unless it is clear that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and as a result there had been an injustice; Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA 93 and Openda v Ahn [198288] 1 KAR 294 applied. In this instance, it was clear that the trial Judge unreasonably refused the request for an adjournment and as a result was clearly wrong in the exercise of her discretion. Even in the absence of the doctors evidence, there was credible and unchallenged evidence of injuries suffered by the Appellants upon which the judge could have awarded damages for pain and suffering.  The official afternoon working hours of the court were from 2 to 5 pm and unless there were special reasons for doing so, the trial Judge erred in hearing the suit past 5 pm on 18 May. The appeal would therefore be allowed and the suit remanded to the High Court for a fresh hearing before a different judge.
