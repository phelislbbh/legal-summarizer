Editors Summary  The appellant, a police officer, obtained a loan without interest from a person whose conduct he was  investigating. He had been friendly with him before and previous small loans had not been repaid.  The appellant appealed from his conviction for corruption alleging that there was no real connexion  with the investigation, and that the absence of interest was immaterial.  For the respondent it was submitted that a loan without interest must always be for an inadequate  consideration.  Held   (i) the mere absence of interest is not conclusive of inadequate consideration (dictum in Haining v.  Republic (1) explained);  ( ii) on all the facts the consideration was inadequate.  Appeal dismissed.  Case referred to Judgment:  (1) Haining v. Republic, [1970] E.A. 620.
