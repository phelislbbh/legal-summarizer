Editors Summary

The appellant sued the respondent on a promissory note drawn by it and which had been endorsed in favour of the appellant. After the note had come into the appellants possession the appellants name had been stamped on the front of it.

The High Court held that no place of payment was inserted but that an additional payee was added, that the alteration was material and that the respondent was discharged from liability.

On appeal

Held 

(i) No place of payment was added (National Bank of Commerce v. Allidina (2) considered);

(ii) The addition of the name was meaningless and therefore could not be material;

(iii) The addition could not be material as the appellant was already the holder of the note and the addition could not cause the note to operate differently.

Appeal allowed.
