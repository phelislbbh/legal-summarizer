Ajuoga v Republic  Division: Court of Appeal of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 26 January 2007  Case Number: 223/03  Before: Okubasu, Onyango-Otieno and Deverell JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: E Ongoya  [1] Criminal practice and procedure  Prosecutor  Competence of prosecutor  Police prosecutor must be of the rank of assistant Inspector of Police and above  Police officer of rank junior to that not a  competent prosecutor.  Editors Summary  The appellant together with one Omolo Ojwang Gumbo faced three counts of robbery with violence under section 296(2) of the Penal Code. At the conclusion of their trial, the trial Magistrate found them guilty and convicted them. They were both sentenced to death and provided for by law. Their first appeal to the High Court was dismissed. On the second appeal to the Court of Appeal, they raised an issue of the competence of the person who conducted part of the prosecutions case, being a corporal and not an officer of the rank not below that of assistant inspector. The other issue that arose was whether the court was to order a re-trial of the accused or to release them.    Held  For one to be appointed a public prosecutor by the Attorney-General, one must be either an advocate of the High Court of Kenya or a police officer of not below the rank of an Assistant Inspector of  Police. (Roy Richard Elirema and another v R [2003] KLR 537 adopted).  Conviction quashed.  In deciding whether or not to order a re-trial, every case must turn on its own facts and circumstances.  In this case, the circumstances were such as to commend an order for a re-trial.
