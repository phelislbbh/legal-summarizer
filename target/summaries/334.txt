Editors Summary

The appellants filed an appeal against the decision of the High Court ordering it to pay retrenchment benefits to the respondent. The issue of the decree filed then arose. 



Held  The appeal lacks a valid decree per the provisions of Order XXXIX, rule 35(4) of the Civil Procedure Code of 1966 and so the invalid decree renders the appeal incompetent.
