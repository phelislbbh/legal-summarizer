Chesoni and another v Silverstein and another  Date of judgment: 10 March 2006  Case Number: 1444/02  Before: Visram J  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: R Rogo  [1] Civil practice and procedureSummons to enter appearance  Failure to apply for extension of  validity of summons  Whether the Registrar can re-issue summon that have already expired  Effect of defendant having entered appearance.  Editors Summary  The applicant sought to strike out the summons and the plaint on the ground that the same were not served on time.  The original summons were issued on 6 September 2002. They were collected from the registry but not served upon the defendant. However on 11 February 2005, the plaintiffs advocate wrote to the Deputy Registrar requesting reissuance of the summons as the original ones had expired. The Registrar issued fresh summons to the plaintiff giving rise to the present application.  Held  The original summons, once issued, is valid for a period of twelve months. Where service has not been effected within this period, the court may extend its validity for a specified period. However, the application for extension of its validity must be made during the lifetime of the summons, not after it has expired. Once its validity has expired, there is nothing to extend. It is dead. You cannot breathe new life into it nor reissue it.  The Civil Procedure Rules do not allow reissuing of summons. The rules only provide for extension of the validity of the summons but it is not possible to extend a summons that has expired.

The plaint and the summons are inseparable. Without the summons, the defendant cannot be called upon to answer the claims in the plaint.  The fact that the defendant entered appearance could not validate an invalid summons.
