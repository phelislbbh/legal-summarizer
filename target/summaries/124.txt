Editors Summary

The Plaintiff obtained judgment in its favour against the First Defendant and proceeded to levy execution by attaching six motor vehicles belonging to the First Defendant. These motor vehicles were the subject of a hire-purchase agreement between the First Defendant and Kenya Commercial Finance Company Limited and a floating debenture had been created over these motor vehicles in favour of Kenya Commercial Bank Limited (the successor in title of Kenya Commercial Finance Company Limited). Kenya Commercial Bank Limited brought objection proceedings seeking the lifting of the execution against the Plaintiffs motor vehicles on the strength of the debenture. It transpired that the execution was levied before the Objector had appointed a receiver under the debenture. 



Held  Where there was a floating charge over the movable property of an execution debtor created by a debenture, the floating charge crystallised on the date of the appointment of the receiver. As no receiver had been appointed by the Objector in the present case, the debenture had not crystallised. If before the appointment of a receiver by a debenture holder the machinery of execution by attachment and sale has been put in motion by an execution creditor, then the execution creditor has priority over the debenture holder whose charge has not yet crystallised (Kahagi v Kencity Clothing

Limited [1982] KLR 464 applied).

Application dismissed.
