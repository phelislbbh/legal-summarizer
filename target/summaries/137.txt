Editors Summary

The respondent, who was a frequent flier of the appellants Lagos-Entebbe route, lost part of her luggage on reaching the Entebbe Airport. The respondent produced a list of the lost items and valued them at US$ 3 476 and lodged a complaint with the Kampala Area Manager. However, when she did not recover her property or the US$ 3 476, she sued. The High Court awarded her US$ 600 for the 30kgs of the lost luggage and Ush 3 million for the inconvenience and costs under Article 22(a) of the Warsaw Convention. The appellant appealed on the grounds that the court relied on oral evidence and that it was inequitable to grant the sum of 3 million as general damages when it had come to the court with clean hands. 



Held  Both parties were governed by the Warsaw Convention, since under Article 1 it is applicable to international flights made by a carrier. Hence, the terms of the contract and the liabilities between the parties were governed by the Warsaw Convention. Extrinsic evidence cannot be used to vary or alter the contents of a written document. (Uganda Revenue Authority v Stephen Mabosi civil appeal number 26 of 1995 followed). The act of the appellants representative in accepting payment of excess luggage of 10 kilograms was illegal and therefore of no effect. Once an illegality is brought to the courts attention, it overrides all questions of pleadings including admissions. Appeal allowed.
