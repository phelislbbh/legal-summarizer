[2] Civil Practice and Procedure  Plaint  Contents  Name of defendant only required, not names of  servants  Civil Procedure Rules, O. 7, r. 1 (c) (U.).  Editors Summary  The plaintiff claimed damages from the defendant for negligent acts of the defendant for negligent acts of the defendants servants. The defendant objected that the names of its servants should have been set out and that the plaint disclosed no cause of action as it was not specifically alleged that the servants were acting in the course of their employment.  Held   (i) only the defendants name has to be given in the plaint;  ( ii) there is a presumption that an employer is responsible for his servant and it is not necessary to  plead this (Kangave v.
