Editors Summary  The appellant was convicted of the offence of kidnapping with intent to murder by the High Court and  sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. At his trial, it was alleged that the appellant had had an affair with  his niece, AN, which had  Page 141 of [2006] 2 EA 140 (SCU)  resulted in the birth of a boy. Evidence was adduced to the effect that on 24 October 1998 at about 8pm.  The appellant had sent for AN to come from her brothers house and meet him. Following their meeting,  she returned to her brothers house. Later that night, the appellant again sent for her. Because her child  was crying, her brother requested her to take the baby with her. Some time later, AN returned to her  brothers house crying that the appellant had taken her child away from her. The following day she  reported the matter to her mother as well as to the authorities. The appellant was later arrested but the  child was never seen again.  In his defence, the appellant put forward an alibi to the effect that on the night in question he had been  at the mosque, after which he had visited a friend then gone home. He called his friend as a witness to  support his alibi. He also denied having indulged in an incestuous relationship with AN. The trial judge  believed the prosecution case, rejected the defence evidence and convicted the appellant. His first appeal  to the Court of Appeal was rejected.  He now appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that it  was he who had kidnapped the child, that it had failed to scrutinise and re-evaluate the evidence and that  it erred in regard to the alibi. Counsel for the appellant also argued that the prosecution had failed to  prove that the appellant had the intention to murder. Counsel for the respondent supported the Court of  Appeals decision and argued, inter alia, that the Justices of Appeal had correctly directed their minds to  the law and evidence regarding the offence of kidnapping with intent to murder and had properly  evaluated the evidence and arrived at the right conclusion. She also argued that it was not necessary to  include section 235(2) in the indictment and that what had been included in the particulars of the offence  had been sufficient to explain to the appellant what he was charged with.  Held  It was the duty of a first appellate court to properly scrutinise and re-evaluate the evidence of both  the prosecution and the defence; Abasi v Uganda and Bogere Charles v Uganda followed. In this  instance, the Court of Appeal had properly discharged this duty and had not faulted the trial judges  findings on the complainants credibility as a single identifying witness.  Section 155 of the Evidence Act provided that any former statement of a witness relating to the same  fact made at or about the same time the fact took place could be proved to corroborate the testimony of  that witness. Such a statement must have been made either (a) at or about the same time when the fact  took place or (b) before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact; Ndaula John v Uganda  applied. In this instance, the statement made by AN to her brother that her child had been taken away  satisfied the provisions of section 155 and was provable against the appellant.  The Court of Appeal rightly upheld the findings of the trial judge that a love affair had existed  between the appellant and AN.  Counsel for the respondents submission that it was unnecessary to include section 235(2) in the  statement of the offence was erroneous. The inclusion of the subsection was necessary to inform the  accused of the relevant ingredient that the prosecution must prove in order to secure a conviction. The  omission by the prosecution of section 235(2) in the statement of the offence did not occasion a  miscarriage of justice nor did it prejudice the appellant. The prosecution  Page 142 of [2006] 2 EA 140 (SCU)  evidence brought out the fact that the child had not been seen since the kidnapping and intention to  murder was thus rightly presumed and proved.  It was well settled law that an accused person who raised an alibi did not have the burden of proving  it; Sekitoleko v Uganda, R v Johnson and Leonard Aniseth v R followed. In this instance, the Court of  Appeal had reviewed all the evidence for both sides and agreed with the trial judge in rejecting the  appellants alibi and there were no grounds for interfering with this finding.  The sentence imposed on the appellant was lawful and hence the appeal against its severity was  barred by section 5 of the Judicature Act.  Appeal dismissed.
