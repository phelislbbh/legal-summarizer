In the petition, the respondent sought diverse declarations and orders for redress. The appeal is against the judgment of the Constitutional Court for holding that the General Court Martial is a subordinate court and granting a declaration that the detainees were entitled to be released on bail upon completing 120 days on remand in custody.  ISSUES 1. Whether Article 23(6) (c) of the Constitution applies to Proceedings before the General Court Martial.  2. If not, whether this would amount to discrimination contrary to Article 21(1) and (2) of the Constitution.  3. Is the petitioner entitled to any relief?   HELD Detainees were illegally held for all that time and that failure to release them on bail amounted to contravening Article 23(6) of the constitution. Each party was ordered to bear its own costs of the petition
