Editors Summary  The appellant applied in the High Court for an order of certiorari to quash a decision of the East African  Industrial Court sitting in Kenya. The facts are set out in the judgment of Spry, Ag. P.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the Uganda and Tanzanian Unions could not be parties to the dispute and that no award could be made affecting workers residing and working in those countries, that the Industrial Court purported to make an award embodying a report not approved by the Communication Council.  Held   (i) the East African Industrial Court has to apply the separate laws of the partner states and in a  dispute under Kenya law has no jurisdiction to make an award affecting employees in Uganda or  Tanzania;  ( ii) acquiescence cannot create jurisdiction, nor can the unworkability of a law;  (iii) there was only an excess of jurisdiction as regards Uganda and Tanzania;   (iv) the agreement was no more than agreed recommendations to the Communications Council which  is the only body which can take decisions on major alterations of wages or salaries;  (v) it was beyond the power of the Corporation or the Director-General to implement the agreement;  (vi) the Industrial Court must give the Communications Council an opportunity of being heard before  considering a dispute involving major alterations to wages or salaries;  ( vii) a case for the discretionary order of certiorari had not been made out since it was possible that the  order would have no practical consequences and the order was therefore not shown to be  necessary.  Appeal dismissed.  Cases referred to Judgment:  (1) R. v. Lord Newborough (1869), L.R. 4 Q.B. 585.  (2) East African Community v. Railway African Union (Kenya), [1973] E.A. 529
