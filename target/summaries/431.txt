Application seeking a Court order to stay execution of Courts Judgment pending the Applicants appeal to the Court of Appeal.-Contract-Hire-O.48, 0.39 rr 4 (2), (3) and 5 and 0.19 rr 23 (3) and 26 of the Civil Procedure Rules.-
Brief facts:
The Applicant entered into an agreement with the Plaintiff for hire of the Respondents vehicle. Payment was to be on a daily basis. The initial agreement was for a definite period. However, there appears to have been mutual extension of the period of hire. The Respondents case is that the Applicant made a down payment of Shs.140, 000- (which under the agreement would only cover 2 days) and thereafter defaulted. The vehicle was later recovered from Arua where it had broken down. The Respondents claim was therefore basically for the outstanding hiring charges and the towing expense from Arua to Kampala.
Issues
Whether substantial loss may result to the Applicant unless the order of stay is made;-whether the application has been made without unreasonable delay; and 
Whether security for costs has been given by the Applicant.

Held: 
The Applicant satisfied the first requirement 
The second requirement is also in Applicants favour. 
A sum of Shs.5, 000,000- representing about one third of the decretal amount reasonable as security for costs.### invalid font number 1
