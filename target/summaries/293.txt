The Defendant filed a defence and counterclaim. In the counterclaim the Defendant was joined by a  limited liability company, of which the Defendant was the director, as a co-Plaintiff. In the  Page 162 of [2004] 1 EA 161 (CCK)  counterclaim, the two Plaintiffs claimed that the Plaintiff in the main suit had sent an auctioneer, who  was also joined in the counterclaim as a co-Defendant, to restrain the premises. The auctioneer had then  locked the doors to the premises, causing the co-Plaintiffs to lose business. The Second Plaintiff in the  counterclaim also pleaded that the distress was illegal and excessive.  The Plaintiff in the main suit filed his defence to counterclaim and applied under Order VI, rule  13(1)(b) and Order XXXV, rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules for striking out of the defence and  counterclaim and summary judgment. The Plaintiff averred that both the defence and counterclaim were  scandalous, frivolous and vexatious because they disclosed the existence of two concurrent tenancies  over the same premises.  Held  A matter would only be scandalous, frivolous and vexatious if it would not be admissible in  evidence to show the truth of any allegation in the pleading which is sought be impugned, for example,  imputation of character where character is not in issue. A pleading is frivolous if it lacks seriousness. It  would be vexatious if it annoys or tends to annoy. It would annoy or tend to annoy if it is not serious or  contains scandalous matter, irrelevant to the action or defence. A scandalous and/or frivolous pleading is  ipso facto vexatious.  There was nothing scandalous about the defence and counterclaim. The claim as to tenancy by the  First and Second Plaintiffs in the counterclaim connoted two simultaneous tenancies. There could not  have been concurrent tenancies in respect of the same premises and tenancies could not have existed in  the alternative. The pleading was frivolous and therefore vexatious.  The defence and counterclaim was struck out and judgment awarded to the Plaintiff in the original  suit. It was not necessary to consider the application for summary judgment.
