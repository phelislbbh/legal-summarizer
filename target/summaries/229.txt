Editors Summary

The first defendant was a doctor employed in a government hospital. Together with the Attorney-General she was sued for damages for negligence in treatment alleged to have been given by her. The case had not been filed within six months of the alleged neglect. Application was made to strike out the first defendant from the action and an affidavit filed stating that she was not on duty at the time. It was also argued that only the Attorney-General may be sued where the claim is against a civil servant, and that action against her should have been filed within six months of the alleged neglect.

Held

followed);

(iii) a doctor in a government hospital is a public servant and acting in the execution of a public duty

when carrying out his duties.
