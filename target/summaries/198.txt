Kanyua v Nganga  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of ruling: 1 March 2004  Case Number: 2038/96  Before: Ochieng AJ  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: M Kibanga  [1] Affidavit  Affidavit not sworn  Whether unsworn affidavit curable.  [2] Pleadings  Form of  Originating summons supported by an unsworn affidavit  Amended  originating summons supported by sworn affidavit  Whether amended originating summons cure  original originating summons.  Editors Summary  The applicant instituted suit in the High Court by way of originating summons. The respondent filed a replying affidavit saying he was not the registered owner of the suit premises. The applicant applied to join the registered owner as the second respondent. The amended originating summons was supported by the affidavit of the applicant. At the hearing the first respondent raised a preliminary objection saying the originating summons was a nullity because the applicants supporting affidavit had not been sworn. The applicant argued that because the amended originating summons was supported by a sworn affidavit, the original originating summons was not defective.     Held  The filing of an amended originating summons would not cure original originating summons where the originating summons was supported by a defective affidavit. An originating summons not supported by an affidavit is incurably defective; Gawo v Nairobi City Council [2001] 1 EA 69 applied. An affidavit which is not sworn is fatally defective and cannot support an originating summons.  The originating summons was struck out.
