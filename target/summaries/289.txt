Mohan Meakin (K) Limited v Attorney General  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 25 September 2006  Case Number: 4267/91  Before: Visram J  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: R Rogo  [1] Civil procedure  Striking out pleadings  On a consent order if a matter is res judicata.  [2] Civil procedure  Application to amend a plaint to include special damages  When amendment of  pleadings raises new issues.  Editors Summary  The plaintiff and the defendant entered a consent order to the effect that an exemption granted by the Minister of Finance to one of the plaintiffs competitors was null and void. It was further ordered that the issues of general damages would proceed to hearing. Based on the consent order, the plaintiff filed an application to amend its plaint seeking special damages of KShs 1 464 837 167. There was no claim for special damages pleaded in the original plaint. The only claim in the plaint was for general damages. The plaintiffs application to amend the plaint and include the special damages was allowed by the court in default of appearance of the Attorney General. Thereafter, the defendant filed its amended defence invoking the limitation period as it relates to the claim of special damages and denying that the plaintiff suffered any damage. The plaintiff sought to have the entire amended defence struck out.     Held  No court of law will strike out a whole pleading where only some paragraphs are said to be offensive. The issues raised in the amended defence had not been settled through the consent orders and as such, were not res judicata. The amended plaint raised substantially new issues that had not been pleaded in the original plaint. The defendant was entitled to respond to the new claim for special damages, including invoking any statutory defences it had in relation to the new claim.
