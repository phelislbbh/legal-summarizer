Muleya v Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (3)  Division: Comesa Court of Justice at Khartoum Sudan  Date of judgment: 1 July 2003  Case Number: 1/03  Before: Akiwumi LP, Korsah, Nyankiye, Kalaile and Ogoola LJJ  Sourced by: AM Akiwumi  Summarised by: C Kanjama  [1] COMESA  Tort of libel  Whether press release on previous court ruling defamatory of Applicant   Whether Applicant entitled to damages.  [2] Tort  Libel  Press release on court findings  Defamatory matter through imputation in press  release  Whether plea of justification established  Whether Applicant entitled to damages  COMESA  Court.  Editors Summary  The Applicant filed an application for reinstatement at the COMESA Secretariat. In a reasoned ruling, the COMESA Court refused to order reinstatement. The COMESA Secretariat, the Respondent, issued a press statement of the said court decision. The said press release was not objective as it only highlighted the findings of the Court which were favourable to the Secretariat, and the said findings were misconstrued. The Secretariat stated that the Applicants services had been terminated on the basis of poor performance. The Applicant then filed the current reference claiming that the press release by the Respondent was defamatory. The Respondent did not dispute the publication of the words complained of but entered a plea of justification. It was argued that the imputation in the press release that the Applicants services were terminated on the basis of poor performance was true.     Held  The words complained of clearly imputed that it was the Courts decision that it could not reinstate the Applicant as Director on the basis of poor performance. This imputation was wrong, and the plea of justification could not be upheld. The publication of the defamatory matter was worldwide, since it was carried both in print and electronic media. There was evidence that the Applicant had subsequently been unable to obtain a job in the private sector, although he subsequently obtained a prestigious job in the public sector. A fair estimate of damages would be US$ 2 000. In the circumstances of this particular case, it would not be necessary to grant injunctive relief against the further publication of the defamatory words. Reference granted.
