Noble Builders (U) Ltd and another v Sandhu  Division: Supreme Court of Uganda at Mengo  Date of ruling: 4 March 2004  Case Number: 15/02  Case Number: 15/02  Before: Mulenga JSC  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: M Kibanga   [1] Costs  Security for costs  Supreme Court Rules  Rule 100(3)  Circumstances under which  security for costs may be ordered in appeal.  Editors Summary The respondents petitioned to the High Court for orders to wind up the first applicant and declare the second applicant a delinquent director and the orders sought were granted. The applicants successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal and the High Court decision was set aside with costs to the applicants. The respondents appealed to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile the applicants filed bills of costs were assessed at total of UShs 34 164 400. The applicants filed an application in the appeal to the Supreme Court contending that they would incur further costs if they won in the appeal and prayed for orders inter alia that the respondent furnishes further security for costs, past costs and costs of the pending appeal. The respondent lived in Canada and had no assets or business interests in Uganda.     Held  It is well settled that the burden lies on the applicant to show sufficient cause why the appellant should furnish further security for costs over and above the amount fixed by the rules. What amounts to sufficient cause is a matter for the Courts discretion, depending on the circumstances of the case before it. Demonstrable lack of reasonable chances of success for an appeal is sufficient cause. Inability to pay per se is not a ground for ordering security for costs; De Bry v Fitzgerald and another [1990] 1 All ER 560 distinguished. A defendant should be entitled to security if there is reason to believe that, in the event of his succeeding and being awarded costs, he will have real difficulty in enforcing the order. Application allowed. Further security for costs ordered.
