Editors Summary  The complainant was approached by two people at about 8:00 pm in September 1996 who wanted to hire  his taxi. Hiring charges were agreed on and the complainant drove the people to a hotel where two other  people joined them in the car. The complainant then drove towards the agreed destination. The  Appellants were among the four persons. Upon reaching the destination, the persons refused to alight  from the car. One of the passengers threw a rope around the complainants neck while the others hit him  with a hammer and a spanner. When the complainant tried to run away, he was hit again and he fell down  unconscious. The assailants then escaped with the car.  The complainant later regained consciousness and sought treatment. The vehicle was recovered the  following day in the First Appellants compound. All the Appellants were arrested at the home of the  First Appellant and charged with robbery. In their defence the Appellants stated that they had taken the  complainants vehicle pursuant to a sale agreement with the complainant. The High Court rejected the  Appellants story, accepted the prosecutions case convicted and sentenced the Appellants to death.  Page 532 of [2000] 2 EA 531 (CAK)  The Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was dismissed. They then appealed to  the Supreme Court on the grounds that there were material contradictions in the testimonies of the  prosecution witnesses, and that the court haderred in finding that violence had been used and that deadly  weapons had been used on the complainant.  Held  Minor contradictions not deliberately made in order to mislead the court did not prejudice the  Appellants case; Tajar v Uganda EAC number 167 of 1969 (UR) followed. Concerning hearsay  evidence, the trial court had relied on some other evidence which was not hearsay and the portion of the  evidence which was hearsay was severable from that shed upon by the court.  There was sufficient evidence to show that violence had been used on the complainant. The conduct  of the Appellants, including removing the number plates from the complainants vehicle was not  consistent with that of ordinary buyers but of robbers.  The evidence showed that the Appellants had used a hammer weighing 2 kilograms to assault the  complainant on the head, which was capable of causing death; Wasajja v Uganda [1975] EA 181 and  Birumba and another v Uganda (SC) criminal appeal number 32 of 1989 (UR) distinguished. The  weapon used by the Appellants, a hammer, was a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 273(2) of  the Penal Code.  Appeal dismissed.
