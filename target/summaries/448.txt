Editors Summary The respondents produced accounting systems and forms, some general in nature and some specially designed for the needs of a particular customer. There was no obligation upon such a Customer to order the forms or to pay for the cost of design if he did not want to place an order. The appellant copied certain of the forms and on the respondents suit the High Court held that it had infringed the respondents copyright. On appeal the appellant contended that an accounting form could not be an artistic work eligible for copyright, that sufficient labour and skill had not been put into the forms to give them an original character, and that if copyright existed in the forms specially designed it vested in the firms which commissioned the forms.   Held   (i) (Sir William Duffus, P. dissenting) accounting forms can be artistic works eligible for copyright;  ( ii) (Law, J.A. dissenting) there was no sufficient labour and skill expended on the general forms to give them an original character;  (iii) (Sir William Duffus, P. dissenting) there was sufficient labour and skill expended on the specially designed forms to give them an original character;  (iv) (Law, J.A. dissenting) copyright in the specially designed forms vested in the customer for whom they were produced.
