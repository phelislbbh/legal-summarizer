Editors Summary

Two accused persons were charged and convicted of the offence of cutting and removing forest produce contrary to the Forest Act. The said statute provided for payment of compensation to the forest officer by the convict or his principal, and for forfeiture of tools or implements used in the commission of the offence. Pursuant to these provisions, the court ordered the forfeiture of the motor vehicle used in the carriage of the unauthorised forest timber. The Appellant, unrelated to the accused persons, applied to the High Court to exercise its powers of revision and order release of the forfeited motor vehicle. The Applicant claimed that he was the owner of the said motor vehicle, and that he had not been given an opportunity to be heard prior to the making of the said forfeiture order. The High Court refused to grant the order of revision on the ground that no illegality or impropriety had been committed by the trial Magistrate. On appeal. 



Held  The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to entertain appeals from refusal to exercise power of criminal revision. There is no requirement under the Forest Act that any person be heard before an order for the forfeiture of tools or implements used in the commission of an offence. The proceedings before the trial Magistrate did not disclose any illegality or impropriety and the refusal to make any orders of revision was justified. Appeal dismissed.
