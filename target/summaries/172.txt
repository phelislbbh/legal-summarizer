On the day that application came for hearing they were not in court, as a result of this mistake.  ISSUES Whether the applicant has a defence on the merits.  HELD The applicant not only failed to disclose any facts that may entitle it to defend, but the applicant had not in fact simultaneously applied for leave to appear and defend which it ought to have done.-The excuse may have been sufficient to explain the absence of counsel and his client from court on that day, but taken alone it was not sufficient to vacate a decree lawfully entered, as it had failed to show if it was entitled to defend the suit on the merits. Application dismissed with costs. ### invalid font number 1
