Editors Summary  The petitioner was a member of the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) and a member of  Parliament, representing the UPDF. As a result of his comments, the petitioner was directed by the  President, as Commander-in-Chief of UPDF, to write to the Speaker tendering his resignation. He  subsequently wrote the resignation letter and was arrested thereafter and charged in a court martial.  Subsequently, the petitioner filed this petition seeking, inter alia, declarations that the actions of the  Commander-in Chief and the army commander directing him to resign contravened Articles 80, 83 and  84 of the Constitution; that the Speakers action in accepting and declaring his seat vacant, on the basis  of his letter, contravenes section 83(1), 80 and 84 of the Constitution; and that the act of the UPDF  restraining him from expressing political matters while allowing others to do so contravened Articles 20  and 29 of the Constitution. The petitioner also sought damages for violation of his rights and freedoms of  speech, movement and assembly and an order prohibiting the Electoral Commission from declaring his  seat vacant or conducting elections to replace him.  Held  The President of Uganda, with the four attributes in Article 98(1) of the Constitution, is at all  times entrusted with the complete control of the affairs of state. He occupies a unique office with powers  and responsibilities so vast and  Page 292 of [2005] 2 EA 291 (CCU)  so important that public interest demands that he devotes his undivided time and attention to his public  duties.  Unless the President is immune from the legal proceeding while holding office, there exists a threat of  judicial interference with the Executive branch through orders and other court decisions, which would  violate the separation of power principle. (Baker v Cart 369 US 1962 applied).  However, the courts can review the Head of State powers if the President acts in bad faith or  misconstrued his powers. When exercising his duties, he must do so legally and constitutionally. He has  to exercise his powers in a non-arbitrary manner. As long as the President acts in good faith and if the  political decisions are objectively rational, the court will not interfere with the decision because it  disagrees with it.  On a proper interpretation of the Constitution and other relevant laws, there is nothing to stop the  court from entertaining a complaint challenging the Presidents act or acts. (William Jefferson Clinton v  Paula Corbin Jones 520 US [1997] considered).  However, challenging the act or acts of the President is one thing and prosecuting him and bringing  him before a court of law is another. Under Article 98(4) the President cannot be prosecuted for a  criminal offence or sued in a civil action in any court except in a Presidential Election Petition.  With regard to the parties to the action for complaints against an act or acts of the President, the  proper respondent or person to sue is the Attorney-General.  The fact that the petitioner wrote the resignation letter on the directive of the Commander-in-Chief  did not affect the effectiveness of the letter to the Speaker. The directive did not contravene sections 80,  83 and 84 of the Constitution.  It is not a requirement for the Speaker to investigate the reasons for the resignation. All that was  required was fulfilled and hence the letter was an effective resignation.  Notification of the Electoral Commission, by the Speaker, that the petitioners seat had fallen vacant  did not contravene Articles 80, 83 and 84 of the Constitution.  Under section 10(4) of the UPDF Act (Chapter 307) the UPDF operates under the general direction of  the President. The President, as Commander-in-Chief of the UPDF, has the authority to direct or guide  any soldier, including an army representative in Parliament on any military matter.  Soldier members of Parliament are full members of Parliament with equal rights and obligations as  the civilian members of Parliament. They subscribe to an oath of office to defend, support and uphold the  Constitution at all times. However, the petitioner remained a soldier and had to obey the Army Code of  Conduct and observe the discipline. To defend the Constitution, the petitioner does not have to commit a  breach of the law. He is enjoined to employ lawful means to fulfil his obligations. The rights and  freedoms under Articles 20, 21 and 29 must be enjoyed within the confines of the law. Those rights are  not absolute. They are important but are not derogable freedoms under Article 44 of the Constitution.  Page 293 of [2005] 2 EA 291 (CCU)  By participating in radio talk shows and making statements to outsiders without permission from the  relevant authority was an offence under the UPDF Act (sic). Military standing orders, army code of  conduct and other military law are enacted in accordance with the Constitution to operationalise it. The  petitioner should, therefore, not have chosen those methods to defend the Constitution and fulfil his  obligations as a member of Parliament. He should have employed appropriate ones.  Preferring charges against the petitioner in the circumstances in which it was done was not  inconsistent with and did not contravene Articles 20, 21 and 29 of the Constitution.  Once an army representative is allowed to subscribe to an oath of member of Parliament, he or she is  faced with two masters to serve, the army code of conduct and the oath of member of Parliament. In this  case, the oath of member of Parliament will always sway. (per Mpagi-Bahigeine and Twinomujini JJA  dissenting)  Pressing charges against the petitioner would conflict with and violate Articles 20, 21 and 29 of the  Constitution. (per Mpagi-Bahigeine and Twinomujini JJA dissenting)  The President has total immunity against court proceedings both criminal and civil arising out of his  or her acts or omissions done or omitted to be done either before or during his or her term in office as  President. Any person wishing to challenge those acts or omissions of the President in court has to wait  until the President has ceased to be one. The only exception to this is for a challenge of the election of a  President of a person who happens to be the incumbent President at the time of the challenge. If the  framers of the Constitution had intended the acts of an incumbent President should be challengeable in  court, they would have clearly stated so, given the fairly detailed manner in which the Constitution deals  with the question of Presidential immunity in Article 98. Where they wanted an exemption to this  immunity, the framers of the Constitution said so in Article 109(8). (William Jefferson Clinton v Paula  Cobin Jones 520 US 681 distinguished) (per Kavuma JA dissenting).  The duty of the court is to interpret, not to amend or re-write, the Constitution. Courts should resist  the temptation to venture into unnecessary judicial interpretations of the Constitution contrary to its clear  provisions (per Kavuma JA dissenting).  To strike a difference between challenging the acts of the President in a court of law and making the  President a party to court proceedings or arguing that where a party seeks to challenge the acts of the  President in court such a party sues the Attorney-General is academic. The effect of either is to erode the  Presidential immunity embodied in Article 98 doing so would greatly undermine the rationale behind the  Article, which is to cater for the peoples aspirations about the person and office of the President. This is  the preservation of the dignity of both the person and the office of the President. (per Kavuma JA  dissenting)  The Constitution puts the question of how to promptly handle the liability of court proceedings by an  incumbent President or immediately subjecting his or her acts or omissions to judicial review, beyond the  courts competence. It leaves it to the people, who through the exercise of their sovereignty, either  directly or through their representatives in Parliament, may bring an end to the  Page 294 of [2005] 2 EA 291 (CCU)  incumbents presidency thereby opening the door for legal action to be taken against him or her  (Attorney-General v Tinyefuza Constitutional appeal number 1 of 1997 applied) (per Kavuma  dissenting).  Where the President assigns any of his executive powers to ministers or other officers under Articles  99(4) and 113(3) of the Constitution, immunity does not extend to such other ministers or officers.  Where such ministers or officers act or omit to act in such a manner as to attract legal challenge or  liability to government, the Attorney-General is sued in his representative capacity under Article 119(c)  of the Constitution.
