N Ltd v Income Tax  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 17 September 1973  Case Number: 56/1972 (46/74)  Before: Trevelyan J  Sourced by: LawAfrica  [1] Income Tax  Capital or income receipt  Profit on sale of plot originally bought for trading from   Capital receipt  Change of intention immaterial.  Editors Summary  The appellant was a distributor of petroleum and petroleum products and held exclusive rights in two provinces. It had never previously bought a plot and sold it. In 1966 the company acquired a plot so that a petrol station might be built on it from which Caltex products could be sold. Only after distribution rights had been refused to it did the appellant sell the plot, making a profit on the transaction. The respondent assessed the appellant to income tax contending that there was a change in intention which required the transaction to be considered as a revenue one, the plot having been developed before sale.     Held   (i) the appellant bought the plot in order to trade from it;  ( ii) on being unable to do so, the only prudent course was to sell;  (iii) the profit was not made from an adventure in the nature of trade (Leeming v. Jones (2) considered).  Appeal allowed.  Cases referred to Judgment:  (1) Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Livingston, 11 T.C. 538.  (2) Leeming v. Jones, 15 T.C. 333.  Page 12
