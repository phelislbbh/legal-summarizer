Kabebe v Makau and another  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of ruling: 22 April 2004  Case Number: 1222/99  Before: Ochieng AJ  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: M Kibanga  [1] Affidavit  Jurat  Jurat not stating where affidavit sworn  Whether omission fatal  Section 5   Oaths and Statutory Declarations Act (Chapter 15)  Rule 10  Oaths and Statutory Declarations Rules.  [2] Amendment  Leave to amend Plaint amended without leave  Whether entire suit liable to be  struck out.  Editors Summary  Before the commencement of the trial of the suits the first and third defendants raised preliminary objections to the suits on grounds, inter alia, that one of the suits was based on a plaint that was amended without leave of the Court and that the affidavit in support of the plaintiffs originating summons was incurably defective because the jurat did not state where the affidavit was sworn. They asked the Court to strike out the two suits.  Held  Although the plaintiff amended his plaint in the first suit without leave of the Court the main suit would remain alive and only the amendments would be struck out. Section 5 of the Oaths and Statutory  Declarations Act and rule 10 of the Oaths and Statutory Declarations Rules requires that the place where an affidavit is sworn be indicated in the jurat. The embossment of a commissioner for oaths rubber stamp showing Nairobi is not in compliance with rule 10 because that only shows the commissioners postal address.  The omission in the jurat to state where the affidavit was sworn is not fatal and the Court has a discretion to allow an affidavit notwithstanding the omission. The Court may in some instances direct that the affidavit be re-sworn.
