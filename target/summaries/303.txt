IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGANDA AT KAMPALA ?(COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION)??HCT-00-CC-MA-0702 OF 2005?(Arising from HCT-00-CC-MA-0105-2004 and HCT-00-CC-CS-0079-2004)
??MUKABURURA FOUNDATION?INVESTMENTS LTD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: APPLICANT
VERSUS
?SOUTHERN INVESTMENTS LIMITED::::::::::::: RESPONDENT?
?FACTS
Following the grant of leave to appear and defend to the Respondent in the main suit, the Applicant felt aggrieved by the decision of the Court and appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the Court of Appeal, counsel for the Respondent successfully challenged the competence of the Appeal which had been filed without leave being sought and/or granted. The Appeal was dismissed on account of that. Applicant now seeks to start the process all over again. Hence this application.

ISSUES
Whether there is a bonafide triable issue of fact or law.

HE;LD
no amount of argument would lead any Court to circumvent these two grounds on appeal. Accordingly, the exception stated in Spry, V.Ps observation in the Sango Bay case, supra, clearly supports the Respondents argument that it ought to be heard in its defence of the suit. Whether the defence would succeed or not would be for another day. The Court exercised a judicial discretion in granting leave to the Respondent to appear and defend. The intended appeal therefore lacks any ground that would merit serious judicial consideration. The Applicant stands to lose nothing since any decision of this Court would be open to challenge on appeal. ?
Application dismissed.
