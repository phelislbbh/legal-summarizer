JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE  FACTS The appellant was the plaintiff in the head suit. It retained the respondent, a firm of advocates to handle at some stage, the case for the plaintiff. It contends that this was at agreed lump sum. The respondent on the other hand, filed a notice of motion, applying for leave to commence a suit to recover its fees and costs from the appellant, and that the advocate/client bill of costs be taxed, among other relief sought. At the hearing of that application, the appellant objected to the taxation of the bill of costs, contending that it was not due, as they had agreed upon a lump sum to cover the fees for the respondent.  ISSUES whether the trial decision to award the bill of costs was premature and bad in law whether the appeal was lodged in time  HELD -Court noted that the appeal was out of time -Court held that the sums agreed upon had to be taxed since the appellant showed no clear proof that the agreement with the Advocate was out of the bracket of s 54 of the Advocates Act
