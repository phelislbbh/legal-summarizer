Editors Summary

The appellant was tried and convicted of the offence of murder by the High Court. At his trial, evidence was adduced by the prosecution to the effect that on 1 July 1999, the appellant cut the deceased, whom he apparently owed some money, with a panga. Testimony was heard from one witness who saw the appellant cut the deceased and from another who testified that he met the appellant fleeing the scene with the panga. After the attack, the appellant disappeared from the village. He was eventually arrested in

Tanzania some ten months later. In his defence the appellant claimed that he was not at the scene on the material day as he had gone to Tanzania to seek employment. The trial court rejected the alibi defence and convicted him. His first appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

He now appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal had failed to evaluate the appellants evidence and that it had relied on evidence that was tainted with falsehoods, contradictions and inconsistencies. He also appealed that he had not been allowed to mitigate regarding the sentence.

Held  The evidence of the two witnesses, who had known the appellant since childhood, together with the fact that the incident happened in broad daylight disproved the appellants alibi. The Court of Appeal had re-evaluated the evidence regarding the alibi and had been in agreement with the trial court that the appellant was at the scene and that his alibi should be rejected.

There was no inconsistency between the evidence of the first prosecution witness and the post-mortem report. Accordingly, the courts below could not be faulted for finding that the witnesses testimony was reliable.

With regard to the issue of mitigation, confirmation of the sentence would be postponed until determination of the appeal in Constitutional Petition number 6 of 2003.

Appeal against conviction dismissed, confirmation of sentence deferred.
