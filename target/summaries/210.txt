Editors Summary

The appellant, the widow of a Muganda, was the daughter of a Ghana African and an English mother.

She applied to be registered as the proprietor of mailo lands and when this was refused contended in the High Court that she was a member of an indigenous African tribe, that of her father. The High Court found against her and on appeal the argument was advanced that she had become a member of the

Baganda community.

Held

( ii) an indigenous African tribe means a tribe indigenous to Uganda;

(iii) a person may be a member of an indigenous African community if accepted as a member of it;

(iv) there was no evidence on which the court could find that the appellant was a member of the

Baganda community.

Appeal dismissed.
