Editors Summary

The Kenya National Federation of Co-operatives Limited (KNFC) filed an application seeking leave to apply for judicial review to squash the decision of the Communication Commission of Kenya (CCK) which has granted a global service mobile (GSM) licence to accompany called Econet Wireless Kenya Limited (EWK). KNFC also sought an order of mandamus compelling CCK to grant KNFC the GSM license. The application for leave was granted and was to operate as a stay pending the hearing and determination of the main application. It was ordered that EWK be made a party to the proceedings. EWK was aggrieved by the granting of the leave to stay and filed an application for the Court to discharge the stay under and dismiss the KNFCS application. The grounds of the application were inter alia that KNFC had not made material disclosure in its application of 26 November 2004. Rapsel Limited, a member of EKW, opposed the application on the ground that one Zachary Wazara who had sworn to the affidavit on behalf of EWK was not authorised or competent to do so. The objection was preliminary in nature. The objection was opposed on the ground that Mr Wazara was presumed, as the director, to have authority to swear to the affidavit. It was argued that Mr Wazaras interest in EWK conflicted with those of the other shareholders. 

Held  The issue of directorship was contended by both sides and raised facts which required evidence to be determined by the Court. It was not a pure point of law. The action of Mr Wazara to instruct counsel and to swear to an affidavit was done bona fide to protect the companys asset, namely the GSM licence and there was no suggestion that action was done ultra vires. The act was capable of ratification by the board of directors; Banford v Banford [1969] All ER 969 adopted. The objection raised on the basis of there being conflict between Mr Wazaras interest and those of the other shareholders was again one of fact. The Court had no jurisdiction to deal with any internal company conflicts under Order LIII. Although EWK was an interested party or a secondary respondent it had sufficient interest in the matter, the licence being its asset, to bring the application. The non-disclosure of material facts by KNFC in the application for leave was deliberate and calculated and had the said facts been disclosed the Court might have reached a different conclusion. The rule of the Court requiring uberimae fides on the part of an applicant for an ex parte injunction applies equally to the case of an application for a writ of prohibition, King v General Commissioners for Purposes of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kesisington [1917] 1 KB 48; R v Metropolitan Police Force Disciplinary Tribunal, ex parte Lawrence [1999] EWHC Admin 588; R v Leeds City Council ex parte Hendry [1994] Admn LR 444 D all approved; Uhuru Highway Development Ltd v Central Bank of Kenya and others [1995] LLR 389 (CAK) applied, Memory Corporation PLC v Sidhu (number 200) 1 WLR 1443 applied. The Court must insist on strict compliance with the rules pertaining to nondisclosure in order to afford protection to the absent parties at the ex parte stage. The order of stay was discharged and the KNFCS application for leave dismissed with costs.
