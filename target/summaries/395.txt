[1] Judicial review  Application for leave to commence proceedings  Whether leave to operate as stay

 Applicable principles.

Editors Summary

By application dated 25 October 2005, the applicant sought leave to apply for an order of certiorari, to move into the court and quash the contracts between Kenya Bureau of Standards and SGS on the one hand and Intertech International Limited on the other, for the provision of pre-shipment verification of conformity to standards, dated 14 September 2005, among other orders. The applicant also sought orders that the leave so granted does operate as stay of implementation of the contracts in question and of any operations thereunder, pending the hearing and determination of the judicial review proceedings. 



Held  An application for leave to commence proceedings in the nature of judicial review does restrict the court to threshold issues, namely whether the applicant has an arguable case and whether, if leave is granted, the same should operate as a stay. Judicial review remedies are discretionary and that discretion is a judicial discretion and, therefore, the court has to explain how the discretion, if any, was exercised so that all the parties are aware of the factors which led to the exercise of the courts discretion and also so that in case of an appeal, the appellate court is able to ascertain how and why the courts discretion was exercised in the manner or way it was exercised. An arguable case is not ascertained by the court tossing a coin or waving a magic wand or raising a green flag, the ascertainment of an arguable case is an intellectual exercise. One has to consider, without making any findings, the scope of the judicial review remedy sought, the grounds and possible principles of administrative law involved and not forget the ever expanding frontiers of judicial review and perhaps give an applicant his day in court instead of denying him. Like the Biblical mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field and which is the smallest of all seeds but when it grew it became the biggest shrub of all and became a tree so that birds of the air came and sheltered in its branches, judicial review stemmed from the doctrine of ultra vires and rules of natural justice and has grown to become a legal tree with branches in illegality, irrationality, impropriety of procedure and has become the most powerful enforcer of constitutionalism, one of the greatest promoters of the rule of law and perhaps one of the most powerful tools against abuse of power and arbitrariness. The court can refuse to order that leave granted for orders of judicial review does operate as a stay where such a stay would violate the needs of good administration, namely; the speed of decision particularly in the financial field; a proper consideration of the public interest; a proper consideration of the legitimate interest; decisiveness and finality unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.
