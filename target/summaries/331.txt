Editors Summary

The respondent sued the appellant as nominal defendant in respect of injuries caused by an unidentified motor vehicle. He had given the notice required by the Traffic and Road Safety Act 1970, s. 44 (2) but not that required by the Civil Procedure and Limitation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1969, s. 1. The High Court held that notice under the latter Act was not required. On appeal

required;

defendant has no status as a scheduled corporation.
