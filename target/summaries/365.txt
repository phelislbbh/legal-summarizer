[2] Evidence  Books of account  Whether sufficient evidence  Whether other evidence led  Evidence  Act (Cap. 80), s. 37 (K.).  Editors Summary  The appellant was convicted of the theft of money for which he was under a duty to account daily. The actual posting was done by another man. The full facts are set out in the judgment.  On appeal the appellant contended that he had been convicted on the basis of a general deficiency which was insufficient, and that he could not be convicted solely on the books of account.  Held   (i) a charge of the theft of an aggregate amount may be made if there is a duty to account for it on a  certain day;  ( ii) the books of account were not the only evidence produced.  Appeal against conviction dismissed.  Cases referred to Judgment:  (1) R. v. Lambert (1847), 2 Cox C.C. 309.  (2) R. v. Tomlin, [1954] 2 Q.B. 274; [1954] 2 All E.R. 272.  [The Evidence Act (Cap. 80) s. 37 is as follows:  37. Entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business are  admissible whenever they refer to a matter into which the court has to inquire, but such  statements shall not alone be sufficient evidence to charge any person with liability.]
