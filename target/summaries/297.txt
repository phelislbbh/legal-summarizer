[2] Tort  Negligence  Patient disappearing from hospital and found dead  No particular employee of  hospital found negligent  Res ipsa loquitur  Whether hospital liable nonetheless  No rebuttal of  plaintiffs evidence.  Editors Summary  The Plaintiff took his daughter, aged four, to Karatina District Hospital for treatment. Her mother left the girl in hospital at about 5:30pm the same day and when the mother came to see her daughter the following morning, she had disappeared. A search was mounted for the young girl and she was found dead by a river outside the hospital premises. The plaintiff sued the Attorney-General for general and special damages in negligence for the disappearance and the subsequent death of his daughter.     Held  Plaintiff having established that the child was left in the care of the hospital, it was encumbent upon the hospital to prove there was no negligence on its part. The circumstances of the case called for the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor. Although no particular employee of the hospital could be said to have been negligent, the negligence was as a result of some kind of organisational failure; Cassidy v Ministry of Health [1951] 2 KB 343 applied. Liability was entered wholly against the defendant.
