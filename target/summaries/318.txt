Editors Summary

In the course of the appellants appeal it was contended that the offence of unlawful conversion of a vehicle was not a lesser cognate offence to robbery, and that evidence of a hostile witness should be treated differently when it supported the defence. The respondent contended that the evidence of a hostile witness should be treated differently when it supported the defence. The respondent contended that the evidence of a hostile witness is negligible whoever it supports.

Held 

(i) unlawful conversion of a vehicle is a lesser cognate offence to robbery;

( ii) the evidence of a hostile witness is admissible although generally of little value;

(iii) a conviction could not be founded on such evidence;

(iv) nevertheless it is possible that some part of such evidence might be truthful and, if this cast doubt

on guilt, the court could acquit.

Appeal dismissed.
