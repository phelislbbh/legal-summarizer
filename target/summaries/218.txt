Editors Summary

The Plaintiff brought an application seeking the enlargement of validity of two summons to enter appearance. The summons had been issued on 13 August 2001 and as at the time of presentation of the Plaintiffs application, they had already expired. The Plaintiffs application indicated that it would be served on the Defendants but was argued ex parte. There was no indication of any attempts made by the Plaintiff to serve the Defendants. 



Held  The Plaintiffs failure to indicate that the application was ex parte would on its own defeat the application because the court in entertaining an application was guided by the prayers sought by a party. For a plaintiff to obtain an order of extension of summons he had to prove to the court that he had attempted to serve the Defendants and give evidence as to the result of those attempts. The summons in this matter had expired in August 2002 and were incapable of extension (Rajjani and others v Thaithi [1996] LLR 443 (CAK) applied). Application dismissed.
