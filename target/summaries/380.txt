Editors Summary

The appellant obtained a default judgment against the respondent, which judgment was set aside by the

High Court. On appeal against that order the appellant contended that before a default judgment can be

set aside the court must be satisfied both that there is a good defence and that there was a cause for the

delay in appearing.

Held
