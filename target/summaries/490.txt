Editors Summary  The Plaintiff made an application to court seeking temporary injunction to restrain the Defendants from transferring or using certain EI circuit lines pending hearing of the application inter partes, a temporary injunction to restrain the Defendants from using the said EI circuit lines pending arbitration and a mandatory injunction compelling the First Defendant to re-transfer the said EI circuit lines to the  Plaintiff.  The matter was heard ex parte in the first instance whereupon a temporary injunction was given pending the hearing of the application. The Court did not record its reasons for certifying the matter as urgent to warrant issue of an ex parte order.  When the matter came up for hearing inter partes, the two Defendants raised preliminary objections to the application. It was their contention that the Plaintiff had no proprietary interests in the EI circuit lines and therefore the orders sought could not be granted; that a judge must record reasons for allowing the application to be made ex parte and since no reasons were recorded in this case, this was a breach of  Order XXXIX and vitiated any orders made thereby; and that under rules 2 and 11 of the Arbitration  Rules a judge had no jurisdiction to issue an order ex parte. The First Defendant contended that the dispute before the Court was principally between the Plaintiff and Second Defendant and thus the First  Defendant had wrongfully been made a party and adverse orders made against it.  The Plaintiffs reply was that under 7(1) of the Arbitration Act a measure of interim protection could be granted and that the section did not say that such a measure ought to be sought inter partes; and that even though the dispute was principally between the Plaintiff and Second Defendant, the First Defendant was the provider of all lines and the only party who could effect a transfer of the line hence was a necessary party to the suit. The Plaintiff also argued that the many points raised by the Defendants were not a demurrer as they could be canvassed in the main application.  Held  Unless the rules of procedure expressly provided for an application to be heard ex parte, all applications should be heard inter partes and not the not the other way round. It would be contrary to public policy and natural justice if any litigant were to be entitled to obtain any orders at will, and without giving prior notice to those that they maybe adversely affected by such orders (Uhuru Highway Development Limited v Central Bank of Kenya [1995] LLR 2177 (CAK) followed).  In the absence of an express provision to the contrary, the Court lacked jurisdiction to grant ex parte orders under section 7 of the Arbitration Act.  Under Order XXXIX, rule 3(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules, before the Court can proceed ex parte to hear an application for an injunction, it is a condition precedent that not only should it be satisfied that any delay would defeat the object of granting the injunction, but is should also record the reasons for being so satisfied. Failure to comply with these conditions vitiates any orders so obtained and renders the same of no effect (Omega Enterprises (Kenya) Limited v Kenya Tourist Development Corporation and others [1993] LLR 2525 (CAK) applied).  Grounds relating to damages in lieu of an injunction, proprietary interest in the lines and transfer of the lines advanced under the cloak of preliminary objection did not properly constitute grounds of preliminary objection as they did not constitute a pure point of law which if successfully taken would have the effect of disposing the suit or application entirely (Garden Square Limited v Kogo and another [2002] LLR 1695 (CCK); Mukisa Biscuit Manufacturing Limited v West End Distributors Limited [1969] EA 696 followed).  Interim ex parte orders discharged. Application to be canvassed inter partes.
