Kinini v Kiganjo  Division: Court of Appeal at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 4 December 1974  Case Number: 43/1974 (2/75)  Before: Spry Ag P, Law Ag V-P and Musoke JA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Appeal from: High Court of Kenya  Chanan Singh, J  [1] Partnership  Action  Receiver  May be appointed even when partnership denied  Principles.  [2] Equity  Receiver of partnership property  Principles on which appointment made.  Editors Summary  The respondent claimed that a partnership existed between himself and the appellant. He applied for the appointment of a receiver of the property of the alleged partnership. On the application the judge decided that there was a partnership, and that a receiver should be appointed. On appeal the appellant submitted that no receiver can be appointed when the partnership is denied.  Held   (i) the denial of a partnership is only one factor to be taken into account and does not of itself  preclude the appointment of a receiver (Floydd v. Cheney (4) followed; Norway v. Rowe (1) and  Rock v. Mathews (2) not followed);  ( ii) the judge should not have decided on the application that there was a partnership;  (iii) the judge should have decided whether there was a reasonable probability that a partnership  existed;  (iv) on the facts no such probability was shown;  (v) no evidence of irreparable damage had been produced.  Appeal allowed.  Cases referred to Judgment:  (1) Norway v. Rowe (1812), 34 E.R. 472.  (2) Rock v. Matthews (1848), 64 E.R. 102.  (3) Tate v. Barry (1928), 28 S.R. (N.S.W.) 380.  (4) Floydd v.
