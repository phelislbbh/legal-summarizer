Republic v Maitha and another ex parte Waudi  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of ruling: 26 January 2004  Case Number: 802/03  Before: Lenaola AJ  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: A Mwanzia  [1] Constitution  Supremacy  Whether section 27(2) of Local Government Act inconsistent with section  33 of Constitution  Local Government Ministers power to revoke nomination of nominated councillor   Whether revocation void  Section 27(2)  Local Government Act (Chapter 265)  Section 33   Constitution of Kenya.  [2] Judicial review  Certiorari  Nomination of councillor revoked and another appointed vide Gazette notice  Whether Minister had power to revoke nomination  Whether Gazette notice sufficient as personal notice  Whether certiorari could issue.  Editors Summary  The Applicant was nominated by the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) Party as a councillor in the Municipal Council of Mombasa. The party sent the Applicants name for verification by the Electoral Commission of Kenya. The Electoral Commission accepted the nomination, approved his name and forwarded it to the Minister for Local Government for gazettement and formal appointment of the Applicant as a nominated councillor. The Minister for Local Government (First Respondent) proceeded to make the appointment and gazetted the Applicant as a lawfully nominated councillor of the Mombasa Municipal Council. On 20 June 2003, the Minister revoked the nomination aforesaid and published the revocation in the Kenya Gazette Notice number 4201. He also nominated one Fred Oyucho as a councillor in place of the Applicant through Gazette Notice number 4200. The Applicant made an application to the High Court seeking orders of certiorari to quash the Ministers decisions signified under the two Gazette notices aforesaid. It was the Applicants contention that the Minister was required to consult the Electoral Commission of Kenya and political parties as required under section 33 of the Constitution of Kenya before making the revocation. Secondly, the Applicant stated that the Minister was required to serve him notice of the termination as per section 27(2) of the Local Government Act (Chapter 265) and that the Gazette notice was not sufficient. The Applicant contended that in so far as section 27(2) of the Local Government Act purported to give the Minister power to revoke nomination of councillors, it was inconsistent with section 33 of the Constitution which required consultations and was thus null and void. The Respondent opposed the application arguing that the Minister was not required to consult with anybody in revocation of the nomination as per section 27(2) of the Local Government Act.     Held  The Minister did not deliver notice in writing of the Applicants revocation of his nomination as councillor as required by section 27(2) of the Local Government Act. An advertisement or notice to the world in the nature of a Kenya Gazette notice was not such notice as required by section 27(2) aforesaid. It would be against the spirit of section 33 of the Constitution to allow consultations up to the point of appointment without the same process of consultation. The proviso to section 27(2) of the Local Government Act in as far as it purports to contradict section 33 of the Constitution was inconsistent and void. The nomination by the Minister of Fred Oyucho without following set down procedure was also void. Orders of certiorari would accordingly issue to quash the Ministers decision as contained in Gazette notices number 4200 and 4201.  No cases referred to in ruling
