Editors Summary

The defendants applied to court seeking to amend their statement of defence to include a counterclaim.

The application was made a year after service and before the final pre-trial conference stage. The reason given for the delay was that all senior officers of the defendant were abroGad on travel duty.

The defendants counsel requested the Court to grant the application on the ground that the principal officer was abroad on medical reasons. There was no evidence of this set of facts in the supporting affidavit.

Held  There was no evidence to support the contention that the principal officer was abroad on medical grounds. There was also no documentary evidence to support allegations of travel abroad. The defendant had not established a sufficient cause for the delay in filing the application, the same was therefore dismissed.
