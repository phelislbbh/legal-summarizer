Editors Summary

The appellant was convicted of careless driving and on his appeal contended that as the magistrate had rejected the sketch plan prepared by the policeman he should have rejected all his evidence, and that the evidence of the complainant as an interested witness should have been rejected.

Held 

(i) the rejection of a sketch plan does not mean that the policemans oral evidence must be rejected;

( ii) the evidence of an interested witness can be accepted if the court is satisfied that it is reliable;

(iii) on the facts the appellant was properly convicted.

Appeal dismissed.
