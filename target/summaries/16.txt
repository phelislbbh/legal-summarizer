EDITORS SUMMARY  Kersam Ltd was a company engaged in general trading, import and export. In July 1997, Ahmed and another engaged Kersam Ltd to clear and forward two consignments from London to Kigali through the  Port of Mombasa. Kersam Ltd was required to execute a transit bond for KShs 40 million in favour of  Commissioner of Customs and Excise, the Respondent herein. Kersam Ltd effected this by depositing the funds, obtained from Ahmed and the other, in a fixed deposit account with ABC Bank. The requisite exportation documents were eventually lodged with the Commissioner of Customs and Excise but he failed to discharge the bond and instead called it up.  In April 1998, Kersam Ltd sued the Commissioner of Customs and Excise and ABC Bank seeking a declaration and an injunction. In January 1999, Ahmed and the other (Kersam Ltds principals), were joined with leave as Plaintiffs to the action. Kersam Ltds principals filed a second plaint headed Plaint for Second and Third Plaintiffs. The Commissioner of Customs and Excise failed to enter an appearance or defence through the Attorney-General though served with summons. Kersam Ltds principals applied for leave of court that default judgment be entered against the government under Order IXA, rule 7 of the  Civil Procedure Rules. The government failed to file their grounds of opposition and their defence.  The court declined leave and Kersam Ltds principals appealed. It was contended that the failure by the Attorney-General to file a defence and grounds of opposition should have been considered before the trial Judge exercised her discretion.    Held  A Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a judge unless it is satisfied that he misdirected himself in some manner and as a result arrived at a wrong decision, or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the judge was clearly wrong in the exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been injustice. In this case, the learned Commissioner of Assize failed to consider that no grounds of opposition to the application had been filed under Order L or the continued absence of any defence on the record. She therefore based the exercise of her discretion on wrong consideration.  Per curiam: (i) The ever increasing tendency to use a decision of a High Court judge in a matter of discretion as a mere conduit-pipe to this Court should be deprecated. The view that a judges discretion can be attacked if it is wholly wrongly exercised should be treated with great caution because it comes perilously close to substituting this Courts discretion for that of the High Court judge; and that is not permissible. (ii) In principle joinder of parties is allowed as of right, subject to the discretionary power of the court. The heading of the amended plaint in this case did not cause prejudice to the Respondents.  Appeal allowed.  Case referred to in judgment  Mbogo and
