[1] Bankruptcy  Attachment of property  Application by decreee  Holder to sell attached assets belonging to public corporation  Corporation placed under receivership of Parastatal Sector Reform

Commission  Whether attached property should be released to receiver  Section 43  Public

Corporations (Amendment) Act 1993  Sections 9(1), 38 and 45  Bankruptcy Ordinance (Chapter 25).

Editors Summary

The powers vested in the Parastatal Sector Reform Commission under section 43 of the Public Corporations (Amendment) Act go beyond those vested in an ordinary receiver under the Bankruptcy Ordinance. Those powers include, inter alia, the power to write off any debt of a private debtor and the power to reschedule the payment of such debt. Accordingly, the inference must be drawn that where the Commission has been constituted the official receiver of a specified public corporation, a decreeholders title over attached property does not prevail over that of the Commission.
