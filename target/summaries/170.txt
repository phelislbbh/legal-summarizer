Editors Summary  On 27 March 1992 Citibank NA entered into a currency transit policy with Somerset Marine Inc and the  Plaintiffs as co-insurers whereby the insurers agreed to insure Citibank against all physical loss and  damage from transit of currency worldwide to a limit of US$ 15 million. Under the terms the Plaintiffs  share of liability under the policy was 25% and the amount insured was US$ 2 500 000. As at 1 January  1997, the Plaintiffs were the sole assurers under the policy.  Page 53 of [2004] 1 EA 52 (CCK)  On or about 3 January 1997, the Republic National Bank of New York (the consignor) at the  request of Citibank NA Nairobi, delivered two consignments weighing 11kg each comprising of US$ 1  million to the Second Defendant for transmission to Nairobi. On or about 5 January 1997 the said  packages arrived in Nairobi and were transported and released by the Second Defendant to the First  Defendant in their offices at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for onward delivery to Citibank NA  (the consignee). The First Defendant allegedly released the said packages to persons unknown to the  consignee as a result of which the consignee suffered a loss of US$ 1 million.  The Plaintiffs as insurers under the policy, indemnified the consignee for the loss suffered and  brought this suit claiming to be entitled to be subrogated to the rights of the consignee.  After filing of the suit, the Defendant filed an application under Order 14, rule 2 of the Civil  Procedure Rules praying for orders that the issues whether the Plaintiffs claim was time-barred by virtue  of sections 3 and 7 of the Carriage by Air Act 1993 and Article 29 of the Warsaw Convention, and  whether the Plaintiff was the proper party to make the claim, be determined as preliminary issues.  The Court in determining the application addressed itself to the following issues: whether the issues  raised by the Applicant were purely matters of law or whether certain issues of fact must be established  first; whether the Carriage by Air Act 1993 and the Warsaw Convention were the proper statutes to be  invoked in determining whether the suit was barred by limitation of time, and whether the Plaintiffs were  entitled in law to bring the suit in their own names.  Held  The claim to locus standi of the Plaintiff was based on subrogation. For an insurer to be  subrogated to the rights of the insured, the latter must have been indemnified by the former. This could  only be established by calling evidence and was therefore not necessarily a purely legal as opposed to a  factual matter.  Under article 18(1) and (2) of the Warsaw Convention, a carriers liability is only for loss sustained  during carriage by air and during the period when the carrier is in charge of the cargo, whether in an  aerodrome or on board an aircraft. The question whether the loss took place when carriage was in force  or when carriage had been terminated was not a purely legal but factual matter.  The matter was therefore not fit to be determined on a preliminary basis. Application dismissed.  No cases referred to in ruling
