Page 135 of [2000] 1 EA 134 (HCT)  Editors Summary  The Plaintiff initially filed suit against the Defendant in the general division of the High Court but later  applied for leave to withdraw the same and re-file it in the commercial division. The application was  granted on terms that the Plaintiff pay the costs of the suit to the Defendant. The Plaintiff thereafter  re-filed the suit before the commercial division. The Defendant raised two preliminary objections to the  filing of the suit. First, it claimed that the Plaintiff had failed to pay the costs ordered before the general  division. Secondly, it alleged that the plaint was defective as its verification clause did not mention the  particular principal officer who had verified it, contrary to Order XXVIII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure  Code, and that the word belief had been used without stating the grounds of that belief, contrary to  Order VI Rule 15. In reply, the Plaintiff argued that the words on terms in the ruling did not mean  subject to and that, in any case, it had not yet been served with a bill of costs. It also claimed that Order  VI permitted either the party to the suit himself or a person familiar with the facts to verify the pleadings.  The Plaintiff conceded that it had made an error in using the words and belief and called upon the court  to expunge the offending words under section 97 of the Civil Procedure Code.  Held  The use of the words on terms simply meant that the Plaintiff had been condemned to pay costs  before the general division. It was not the setting up of a condition precedent by the court which would  be a blatant violation of the Rules governing the filing of suits in the commercial division.  Order XXVIII, Rule 1 provided that the secretary or any director or other principal officer of a  corporation could sign and verify a pleading on behalf of the corporation. Order VI, Rule 15 on the other  hand, provided that pleadings had to be signed by either the party himself or some other person  acquainted with the facts of the suit. When read together, there was nothing in the Code that required a  principal officer to specify who he was and, in this instance, the requirements of the Rules had been  complied with; Lissu v Gulf Air Co HCCC No 279 of 1999 doubted. Section 97 of the Civil Procedure  Code provided that a court could amend any defect or error in any proceeding in a suit. As both parties  were agreed that there were no grounds to support the use of and belief in the plaint and its use had  been no more than a procedural error, the court was entitled to use its powers to order that the words be  struck out. The Defendants argument that the section was not applicable, as proceedings had not  commenced, was untenable since proceedings in a matter commenced as soon as the suit was filed. The  objections would therefore be dismissed.
