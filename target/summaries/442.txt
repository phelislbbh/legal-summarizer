Editors Summary

Paul K Ssemogerere and Zachary Olum petitioned the Constitutional Court seeking a declaration that the Referendum and Other Provisions Act of 1999 was null and void on the ground that parliament had passed it without a quorum. The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition as incompetent and decided that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court which allowed the appeal and held that the Constitutional Court had jurisdiction to decide whether or not the Referendum and Other Provisions Act was passed in accordance with the provision of the Constitution. The petition was referred back to the Constitutional Court for hearing. The Constitutional Court heard the petition and declared null and void the Referendum and Other Provisions Act which had been passed without the requisite quorum and in disregard of the Constitutional provisions applicable. As a result of that judgment, parliament passed the first amendment to the 1995 constitution (Uganda), namely, the Constitution (Amendment) Act number 13 of 2000. It was introduced in parliament, debated, passed and received presidential assent. The three appellants, Messrs Paul Ssemogerere, Zachary Olum and Juliet Rainer Kafire filed a constitutional petition against the Attorney-General challenging inter alia, the constitutionality of the Constitution (Amendment) Act number 13 of 2000. The Constitutional Court declared by a majority that it had no jurisdiction to interpret one provision of the Constitution against another or others. It decided that it could only hear one ground which it framed, namely, whether Act 13 of 2000 was passed in compliance with the procedural requirements for the amendment of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court dismissed the petition and held that Act 13 of 2000 had properly amended articles 88, 89, 90, 97 and 257 which were specifically enumerated in the long title to the amending bill. The Court further held that the Act had not amended any other articles of the Constitution. The appellants appealed against the majority decision of the Constitutional Court. 



Held  The Constitutional Court was under a duty to make a declaration. In denying that it had jurisdiction to make a declaration, the learned majority Justices of the Constitutional Court had abdicated the function of the Court and their decision was made per incuriam. Attorney-General v Tinyefuza constitutional appeal number 1 of 1997; Ssemogerere and another v Attorney-General [2000] LLR 5 (SCU) followed. Rwanyarare and another v Attorney-General [1999] LLR 43 (CAU); Uganda Law Society and another v Attorney-General [2001] 1 EA 301 overruled. In amending article 88, 89, 90 and 97 of the Constitution, parliament failed to comply with the provisions of the Constitution in that the bill effecting their amendment should have been accompanied by a certification by the speaker of parliament indicating that the bill had complied with the provisions before the presidential assent. The Constitution (Amendment) Act 13 of 2000 was unconstitutional and should be struck out as null and void. Appeal allowed.
