Editors Summary  Following the December 1997 Kenyan general election, the First Respondent was declared the winner of  the presidential elections with the Appellant coming in second. The results of the elections were  published in the Kenya Gazette  Page 116 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  number 79 of 1998 dated 5 January 1998. On 22 January, the Appellant filed a petition in the High Court  challenging the validity of the First Respondents election as president of Kenya. As well as the First  Respondent, the electoral commission of Kenya and its chairman, were named in the petition as  additional Respondents. Notice regarding the filing of the petition against the three Respondents was  purportedly served through the publication in the Kenya Gazette of 29 January 1998 by the Appellants  advocates of notice number 395 dated 22 January 1998. The said notice further directed the three  Respondents to obtain copies of the petitions from the deputy registrar of the High Courts office. The  Respondents thereafter appointed advocates to act on their behalf and to obtain copies of the petition  from the court registry. On 25 January 1999, the First Respondent applied for the petition against him to  be struck out on the ground that he had not been served within 28 days of the publication of the election  results as required by section 20 of the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act. The following  day, the Second and Third Respondents filed a similar notice of motion seeking identical orders to those  sought by the First Respondent. As well as relying on section 20 of the National Assembly and  Presidential Elections Act, the Second and Third Respondents also sought to rely on the provisions of  Rule 14 of the National Assembly (Election Petition) Rules to support their application that the petition  be struck out. Section 20 provided that a petition had to be presented and served within 28 days after the  date of publication of the election results in the Gazette whereas Rule 14 of the National Assembly  (Election Petiton) Rules provided that notice of the petition together with a copy thereof were to be  served within ten days of the presentation of the petition. Rule 14(2) further provided that where no  address was given for service under Rule 10, notice could be published in the Gazette stating that a  petition had been presented and that the Respondent could obtain a copy from the registry. The two  motions were heard together by a bench of three judges of the High Court, which allowed the  applications and struck out the petition. The Appellant appealed against both rulings primarily on the  grounds that the High Court had refused to follow various principles set out in previous Court of Appeal  decisions, that those principles would have worked in his favour and that, by its refusal, he had been  deprived of his established rights. The two appeals were consolidated by consent of all the parties.  Held  The High Court had no power to overrule the Court of Appeal and was bound by the principles of  precedent and stare decisis. Though it had the right and the duty to critically examine the decisions of the  Court of Appeal, it was obliged to follow those decisions unless they could be distinguished from the  case under review on some other principle such as obiter dictum; Cassel and Co Ltd v Broome [1972] 1  All ER 801 and Dodhia v National and Grindlays Bank Ltd [1970] EA 195 approved.  In order to rule on the disputes before them in Chelaite v Njuki and Murathe v Macharia, it was not  necessary for the Court of Appeal to determine the issue as to whether section 20 and Rule 14 were in  conflict. Any pronouncements by the court on this issue in those judgments therefore amounted to  judicial dicta and were not binding on the High Court. Thus, the issue of whether section 20(1)(a) was in  conflict with Rule 14(1) was still open to the High Court to discuss in this petition. There was no reason  to differ with the High Courts conclusion that Rule 14 was in direct conflict with section 20(1)(a) and,  accordingly, did not apply to petitions concerning that section.  Page 117 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  The National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act (Chapter 7) and the rules made thereunder  formed a complete regime with regard to election petitions and no other legislation or rules could apply  unless made applicable by the Act or Rules. Though section 20(1)(a) did not prescribe any particular  mode of service, the best form of service was personal and the courts were obliged to go for that form of  service. Though the Appellant had contended before the High Court that the massive security  surrounding the First Respondent precluded personal service, no effort to serve him had been made and  repelled. Moreover that was a reason that could not have been offered for the failure to serve the Second  and Third Respondents. The Appellant had therefore failed to comply with section 20(1)(a) and the  appeals would be dismissed.
