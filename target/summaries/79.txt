Byagonza v Uganda  Division: Supreme Court of Uganda at Mengo  Date of judgment: 7 April 2000  Case Number: 43/99  Before: Oder, Tsekooko, Karokora, Kanyeihamba and  Mukasa-Kikonyogo JJSC  Sourced by: B Tusasirwe  Summarised by: M Kibanga  [1] Criminal practice and procedure  Age  Appellant stating his age during trial  No order for  medical examination to ascertain Appellants age made  Whether such order necessary  Whether  Appellants age in issue.  Editors Summary  The Appellant was charged with and convicted of the offences of murder, attempted murder and aggravated robbery committed in June 1991. He was sentenced to death in respect of the offences of murder and aggravated robbery and seven years imprisonment for the attempted murder. The sentences in respect of the aggravated robbery and attempted murder were suspended.  During the trial the Appellant had testified that he was twenty-two years old (at the time of the trial).  The offences had been committed three years earlier. The prosecution did not have the age of the  Appellant ascertained at the trial.  The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the age of the Appellant was not ascertained and could have been below 18 years at the time the offence was committed, and asked the  Court of Appeal to quash the sentence. The Court of Appeal ordered the medical examination of the  Appellant to ascertain his age at the time of the offence. The court concluded that the Appellant was above 18 years at the time of the offence. Dissatisfied by that conclusion, he appealed to the Supreme  Court on the grounds that the Court of Appeal did not ascertain the Appellants age and had not complied with section 104 of the Trial on Indictment Decree and section 109 of the Children Statute (1996). The appeal was against the sentence only.  Held  One of the legally acceptable ways of proving age was a statement by a witness of his own age.  Given what the Appellant had said was his age at the trial, the judge had no reason to doubt the age of the  Appellant and, consequently, his age was not an issue at his trial. The provisions of section 104(1) of  Trial on Indictment Decree (1971) were not applicable to the case.  It was unnecessary for the Court of Appeal to order a medical examination of the Appellant, considering what the Appellant had said was his age; Moses Kayondo v Uganda criminal appeal number 11 of 1992, distinguished.  Section 109 of the Children Statute (1996) was irrelevant to the case and was, in any event, enacted long after the Appellant had been tried and convicted.
