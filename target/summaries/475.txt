[2] Intellectual property  Copyright  Prohibitory order  Anton Piller order  Circumstances under which ex parte order will be made allowing search and seizure of infringing articles  Section 13   Copyright Act (Chapter 71)  Editors Summary  The Applicant was the sole assignee of certain musical works. It was apprehensive that the Respondent was infringing on its copyright, and applied to court for an Anton Piller order permitting the search and seizure of infringing materials on the Respondents premises, and for a temporary injunction restraining the continued infringement of the Applicants copyright.  Held  A temporary (as opposed to prohibitory) injunction could not be granted ex parte on the basis of the Judicature Act without invoking the courts jurisdiction under the Copyright Act.  An Anton Piller order may however be granted ex parte if the applicant satisfies the following conditions: (1) there must be an extremely strong prima facie case, (2) the actual or potential damage must be very serious for the applicant, (3) there must be clear evidence that the respondents have in their possession incriminating evidence and (4) there must be a real possibility that they may destroy such material before any application inter partes has been made.  The Applicant had satisfied the Court of these conditions and an Anton Piller order would be granted.  However, the Applicants counsel must attend at the time of service of the order as an officer of the Court. The Anton Piller order would also not permit forceful entry.  Anton Piller order granted.
