Editors Summary

The respondent rented premises from the second appellant company. When he failed to pay his rent the company distrained and the respondent obtained from the High Court an ex parte injunction which was later affirmed. He alleged, but produced no evidence to support the allegation, that the company had been owned by non-citizen Asians and the property had been abandoned so vesting it in government.

Held 

(i) an application for leave to dispense with service of an application for an injunction on the defendant must be made;

( ii) the defendant must be served with the plaint, summons and affidavits in support as well as the order;

(iii) as no evidence was produced to show the ownership of the shares of the company a bare allegation could not be acted on;

(iv) no irreparable loss by the respondent had been shown;

(v) a tenant may not challenge his landlords title at the beginning of the tenancy but may show that it has since determined (dictum of Cockburn, C.J. in Delaney v. Fox (1) followed).

Appeal allowed.
