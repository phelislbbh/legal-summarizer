Editors Summary  The Deposit Protection Fund Board (the Board) lodged timeously, on 13 June 2000, a notice of appeal  against the decision of the High Court which notice stated the parties upon whom the Board intended the  notice to be served. The notice was not served upon at least one of them. The Board also applied to the  High Court for copies of the proceedings. It was alleged that the letter was not filed nor was it copied to  two of the firms of advocates named in the notice of appeal. LZ Engineering Construction Ltd applied to  have the notice of appeal struck out on two grounds but the argument pursued was that the appeal had not  been filed within 60 days of the date of the filing the notice of appeal.  Held  The application would be allowed because the Board could not take advantage of the proviso to  Rule 81(1) suspending the running of time as the letter requesting copies of the proceedings had not been  filed in the High Court and the time for filing the appeal lapsed and as no appeal had been filed by that  date, the notice of appeal was a dead letter and was deemed to be withdrawn.  Under Rule 17(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, absent any special direction, service of a document  must be made personally on the person to be served or a person authorised to appear on his behalf. As the  letter was not copied to at least one of the advocates named in the notice, the proviso to Rule 81(1) could  not enure to the Boards benefit.  Application allowed. Notice of appeal struck out.
