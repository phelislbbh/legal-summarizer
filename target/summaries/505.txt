Editors Summary

The deceased was involved in a road traffic accident on 2 August 1998 and 4:00pm. Good Samaritans took him to Kenyatta National Hospital, owned and operate by the defendant, where he was immediately taken to casualty department.

The plaintiff (the deceaseds father) found out about the accident at about 8:00pm and went to the hospital where he found the deceased unattended but able to talk. The plaintiff took the deceased for X-rays which showed he had fractures of the leg and arm. The plaintiff later took the deceased to ward 6 and the attending doctor in dictated there was nothing he could do as a surgeon was not available. The deceased died at 2:15 unattended.

The plaintiff sued claiming general and special damages in negligence for the deceaseds death.

The defendant filed a defence denying the allegations in the plaint but called no witness in its defence.

Held  A hospital is expected by its very nature to take all reasonable steps to ensure that a patient receives emergency care. No reasonable care was given to the deceased by the defendant. The defendant breached its duty of care to the deceased and was therefore guilty of negligence.

Had there been proper management of the fractures suffered by the deceased, the deceased would probably have survived. The defendants negligence was the cause of his death.

The plaintiff was awarded KShs 8 855 500-00 special and general damages plus costs of the suit.
