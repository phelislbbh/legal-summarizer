Batala v Uganda  [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  Division: Court of Appeal at Kampala  Date of judgment: 25 September 1974  Case Number: 27/1974 (113/74)  Before: Spry V-P, Mustafa and Musoke JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Appeal from: High Court of Uganda  Kakooza, J  [1] Evidence  Confession  Co-accused  Only slight evidence.  [2] Evidence  Confession  Admissibility  Against co-accused in joint trial  Exculpatory statement  not a confession admissible against co-accused.  [3] Evidence  Witness  Hostile  Evidence is unreliable.  Editors Summary  In convicting the appellant of murder, the trial judge relied heavily on a statement made by a co-accused  implicating him and the judge treated the statement as irresistible evidence of guilt.  The judge also relied on the evidence of a witness who had been declared hostile.  On appeal  Held   (i) the confession of a co-accused is only of slight evidential value;  ( ii) the statement of the co-accused was exculpatory and therefore not a confession and not admissible  against the appellant;  (iii) treating a witness as hostile is equivalent to a finding that the witness is unreliable and his  evidence can be given little if any weight.  Appeal allowed.  Page 403 of [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  Case referred to Judgment:  (1) Alowo v. Republic, [1972] E.A. 324.
