Editors Summary

The appellant filed a record of appeal which did not contain a certified copy of the decree appealed

against. Just before the appeal was to be heard, he filed a fresh record of appeal which contained the

decree, contending that he was entitled to file it as a supplementary record, alternatively that he should be

allowed to file it out of time. The reason given was that a clerk had mistakenly followed the High Court

rule.

The appellant wished to resign from the respondent corporation and was offered a gratuity. He

resigned and thereafter the respondent withdrew the offer of gratuity.

Held 

(i) a supplementary record cannot contain one of the basic documents required by the rules;

( ii) sufficient reason had not been shown for the granting of leave to file the decree out of time;

(iii) the appellant had not relied on the offer in acting to this detriment, so as to make the respondent

liable.

Appeal struck out.
