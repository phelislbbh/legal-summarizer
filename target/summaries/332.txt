Editors Summary

The applicant filed a reference under rule 109 of the Court of Appeal Rules against taxation of the respondents bill of costs in the total amount of UShs 17 910 758. 



Held  There is no mathematical formula for calculating awards in taxation but there are accepted principles. (Chandran v Kengrow Industries Limited [2002] LLR 306 (SCU) applied. The taxing officer has also to observe consistency and must take into account inflation. It is important to note that he or she has a discretion which the courts trust he or she would exercise judiciously. Courts are reluctant to interfere with awards of taxation or costs. The court would interfere with the award only if it was so high or low as to cause injustice to the parties. The award must be unreasonable and excessive to justify interference. (Pramchand Raichand Limited v Quarry Services [1972] EA 162 followed). An award of UShs 13 million as costs based on UShs 75 million being the value of the subject matter is rather high. Although there is no laid down mathematical formula 10% of the value of the subject matter would be preferable. (Bank of Uganda v Trespert Limited civil appeal number 3 of 1997; Sieteo v Noble Builders civil appeal number 31 of 1993 SCU followed). Appeal partly successful.
