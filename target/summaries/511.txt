Editors Summary

The appellant was tried and convicted before the High Court on a charge of murder and subsequently sentenced to death. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. He now appealed to the Supreme

Court on the grounds that the justices of appeal had failed to properly consider the principles of

self-defence and provocation and had erred in their consideration of the principle of the dying declaration. In a supplementary ground, he claimed that the Court of Appeal had also erred in not giving him an opportunity to be heard on the question of mitigation of sentence. In this regard, his counsel relied on

Kigula and others v Attorney-General(supra), where the Constitutional Court had held that it was unconstitutional to make the death penalty mandatory, to argue that the case should be remitted to the

High Court with orders that it hear the appellant in mitigation. Counsel for the respondent argued that the case of Kigula(supra) was under appeal and urged the court to stay proceedings in all appeals in which the death sentence had been imposed on the basis that it was mandatory.

Held  The Court of Appeal had properly applied the law to the facts of the case and arrived at a correct decision.

To accept the submissions of the appellants counsel regarding mitigation would be to pre-empt the

Supreme Courts decision in the pending appeal in Kigula(supra). In the circumstances, though the

Constitutional Court decision had to be respected, it could not be implemented while the appeal was pending. Confirmation of the sentence would be postponed pending the determination of the appeal against the decision of the Constitutional Court in Kigula v AG(supra).

Appeal against conviction dismissed, confirmation of sentence deferred.
