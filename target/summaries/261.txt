Magana Holdings Ltd v Mungai  Division: Court of Appeal of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 3 December 1999  Case Number: 143/96  Before: Gicheru, Omolo and Shah JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: W Amoko  [1] Practice and procedure  Court of Appeal  Record of appeal  Contents  Orders  Form of the  orders  Whether an order should be drawn up in the same manner as a decree  Consequences of the  record of appeal containing an order not drawn up in the same manner as a decree  Court of Appeal  Rules  Rule 851(h) and Order XX, Rule 7(1) and (6) of the Civil Procedure Rules  Section 89  Civil  Procedure Act (Chapter 21).  Editors Summary  The Respondent applied to have the appeal struck out as the order which was appealed against and the order granting leave to appeal, both which were included in the record of appeal, were fatally and totally defective as they were not drawn in the same format as that of a decree.     Held  Rule 85(1)(h) of the Court of Appeal Rules does not require an order to be drawn in the same manner as a decree. As the Respondents advocate failed to respond to the Appellants advocates request to approve the draft orders sent to him and the High Courts registry approved and sealed the said orders in terms of Order XX, Rule 7(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules as read with sub-rule (6) thereof, it was not open to the Respondent to argue that the orders as drawn did not comply with procedural requirements. Under the forms prescribed in the various Schedules to the Civil Procedure Rules, the format for drawing a decree differs from that of an order. By section 2 of the Civil Procedure Act (Chapter 21), an order is different from a decree and section 89 of the Civil Procedure Act mandates that rules of procedure shall be followed so far as applicable in any court of civil jurisdiction. It is not required that an order should be drawn up in like manner as a decree. Suryakant Bhagwanji Raja Shah v Aperit  Investment SA overruled.
