Venture Capital and Credit Ltd v Consolidated Bank of Kenya Ltd  Division: Court of Appeal of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of ruling: 8 January 2004  Case Number: 349/03  Before: Tunoi, OKubasu and Githinji JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: C Kanjama  Appeal  Stay pending appeal  Injunction  Respondent seeking to exercise statutory power of sale   Property to be sold charged to Respondent by guarantor  Whether Appellant had locus to challenge  exercise of statutory power of sale  Rule 5(2)(b)  Court of Appeal Rules.  Editors Summary  The Applicant obtained a loan for KShs 7,5 million in 1998. It was partly secured by a charge against a third partys property. Four years later, the debt balance stood at KShs 47,1 million due to non-servicing of the credit facilities. The Applicant applied to restrain the threatened exercise of statutory power of sale by the Respondent. The Respondent raised a preliminary objection that the Appellant, not being the charger, lacked locus standi to challenge the exercise of the statutory power of sale. The court upheld the objection and the Applicant appealed and filed the application under consideration, seeking stay pending appeal and an injunction to restrain the sale of the charged property.  Held  The prayer for stay of execution of the superior court order was misconceived since the superior court had not made any positive order capable of execution.  With respect to grant of an injunction pending appeal, such power is discretionary and to be exercised judicially (Madhupaper International Ltd v Kerr [1985] KLR 840 followed). Courts should exercise the discretion to avoid the situation where an appeal, if successful, would be rendered nugatory (Butt v Rent  Restriction Tribunal [1982] KLR 417 followed). The applicant must also have an arguable appeal (JK  Industries Ltd v Kenya Commercial Bank [1982-88] 1 KAR 1088 followed).  The Appellant had not annexed a memorandum of appeal disclosing any reasonable grounds for the appeal, and had failed to show that he had an arguable appeal by relying on any authorities. There was no evidence that the appeal would be rendered nugatory, the Appellant not having any proprietary right to the property sought to be sold.  Application dismissed with costs.
