Editors Summary

The applicant was security for the attendance of the accused in a criminal case. When the accused failed to appear, the accused applied for discharge from his bond, which discharge was granted.

Thereafter on a later date the applicant was ordered to forfeit his bond.

He applied to the High Court to review this order, and the respondent argued that the first order was a nullity and could be ignored although it had not been set aside by a superior court.

Held 

(i) the first order is valid, even if made irregularly, until set aside by the High Court;

( ii) an order irregularly made can only be set aside when the irregularity has occasioned a failure of justice;

(iii) to uphold the forfeiture of a bond already set aside would occasion a failure of justice.

Application allowed.
