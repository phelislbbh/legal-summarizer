Batala v Uganda  [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  Division: Court of Appeal at Kampala  Date of judgment: 25 September 1974  Case Number: 27/1974 (113/74)  Before: Spry V-P, Mustafa and Musoke JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Appeal from: High Court of Uganda  Kakooza, J  [1] Evidence  Confession  Co-accused  Only slight evidence.  [2] Evidence  Confession  Admissibility  Against co-accused in joint trial  Exculpatory statement  not a confession admissible against co-accused.  [3] Evidence  Witness  Hostile  Evidence is unreliable.  Editors Summary  In convicting the appellant of murder, the trial judge relied heavily on a statement made by a co-accused  implicating him and the judge treated the statement as irresistible evidence of guilt.  The judge also relied on the evidence of a witness who had been declared hostile.  On appeal  Held   (i) the confession of a co-accused is only of slight evidential value;  ( ii) the statement of the co-accused was exculpatory and therefore not a confession and not admissible  against the appellant;  (iii) treating a witness as hostile is equivalent to a finding that the witness is unreliable and his  evidence can be given little if any weight.  Appeal allowed.  Page 403 of [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  Case referred to Judgment:  (1) Alowo v. Republic, [1972] E.A. 324.  Judgment  The considered judgment of the court was read by Spry V-P: On 18 September 1974, we heard this  appeal and allowed it, quashing the conviction of the appellant and setting aside the sentence passed on  him. We now give our reasons.  Mr. Omondi for the Republic, in our opinion very properly, did not support the conviction.  The appellant, together with one Bityobityo Muzeyi, was charged on two counts of murder. He was  convicted on both counts, while his co-accused was acquitted of murder but convicted of having been an  accessory after the fact to the murders.  The victims were a woman named Zabina Kikaziki and her small child. They were found to be  missing when a police officer attempted to serve a summons on Zabina. Eventually, both bodies were  found in a river, about a month after they had last been seen alive.  The case against the appellant consisted of evidence that he led a party to the place where the bodies  were found, on an alleged confession by his co-accused and on evidence of motive. We shall consider  each of them in turn.  First, however, it is necessary to consider the medical evidence as to the cause of death. It was  unfortunate that the doctor was not available for cross-examination. His post mortem report was admitted  in evidence and although it does not appear in the record  we do not know why  it was summarised in  the judgment. Incidentally, the post mortem report was improperly admitted: no formal evidence was  given that the doctors presence could not have been obtained without undue delay or expense and no  evidence, such as evidence of handwriting, to that the report was that of the doctor. Be that as it may, the  essence of the report was that both bodies were thoroughly decomposed, with the heads separated from  the trunks and that the cause of death was suffocation preceded by strangulation. It appears that the hyoid  bones were not broken. In the absence of some explanation of the reasons for the conclusion, little, if  any, weight can be attached to this report. The judge accepted a defence submission that where  decomposition is complete, it is extremely difficult to establish the cause of death but added that this  does not mean that it is scientifically or medically impossible to establish cause of death where the body  is decomposed. As a broad statement, we accept that as correct, but a bare statement that a person has  died of strangulation, supported by no explanatory findings of fact, where neither flesh nor internal  organs remain and no bones are broken, has no evidential value.  We would suggest that consideration be given to the discontinuation of the practice of stating, on the  form of request for a post-mortem examination, the police theory of the cause of death. The late  Professor F. E. Camps, a very famous pathologist, said in his book Camps on Crime:  I myself am reluctant to perform an autopsy with too much prior knowledge. It is unfortunately only too easy  to find what one expects, even to the extent of missing the obvious. . . .  What a court wants from a post-mortem report is a statement of everything abnormal about the corpse,  not merely the pathologists opinion as to the  Page 404 of [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  immediate cause of death. For example, details of non-fatal injuries may be of great value in  corroborating or contradicting the evidence of witnesses about the events preceding the death, and so be  highly relevant to the question whether a killing constituted murder or manslaughter.  As we have said, the main evidence against the appellant was to the effect that he voluntarily took a  party of chiefs and others to the place where the bodies were found. This would, if true, be highly  incriminating. Two questions arise in this connection. First, there is conflicting evidence whether the  bodies were found floating or submerged. The judge made no finding on this. It is of importance, because  if the bodies were submerged, only the guilty person or persons would know where to find them, but if  they were floating, anyone might have seen them. It is, we think, sufficient to refer to the evidence of two  witnesses. Heneriko Ngobi, the mutala chief, said in his evidence, given more than sixteen months after  the event, that the bodies were submerged but in the statement he made to the police, he is recorded as  having said that the bodies were floating. This statement is not evidence of the fact but it casts grave  doubt on the reliability of the witness evidence. The same applies to the evidence of Sosipateri  Kiwagama, a constable, who said in evidence that he did not know where the bodies were before  arresting the appellant, but who was recorded in his police statement as having said the reverse. It should  perhaps be added that the bodies had originally been weighted with a stone but the stone was not  recovered until a day after the recovery of the bodies.  The other question is whether the appellant went voluntarily to the place where the bodies were  found. Here, again, there is some conflict of evidence. In this connection, the judge said that the accused  persons did not allege that they were beaten on the way but only at the time when the bodies were  recovered. This is literally correct, but both accused alleged that they had previously been severely  beaten and if this were true, the influence of it on their minds would hardly have disappeared. On this  issue, the judge made a specific finding that the accused persons had gone voluntarily.  On this aspect of the case, we would only say that while the evidence was incriminating, perhaps  gravely so, it was such that it would not have been safe to convict on it alone. This the judge appreciated  and he looked for, and found, other evidence.  For the sake of completeness, we would mention here that two witnesses alleged that the appellant  made highly incriminating remarks before the bodies were recovered. It would appear that this evidence  was inadmissible and, presumably for this reason, the judge ignored it.  The judge did, however, rely heavily on a statement made to a magistrate by the appellants  co-accused, regarding it as a confession and treating it as irresistible evidence of the guilt of the  appellant. With respect, this was a fatal misdirection. If the statement were believed and if it amounted to  a full confession, it could be taken into account against the appellant, but it has repeatedly been held by  this court that such evidence is of slight evidential value and can only be used to give final assurance to  an already strong case.  In the present case, the statement made by the co-accused cannot even be regarded, for this purpose,  as a confession. What he was seeking to do was to exculpate himself and inculpate the appellant. He  claimed that his first connection with the affair was when he met the appellant after the murders and all  that he admitted was helping, under duress, to dispose of the bodies. Such a statement was totally  inadmissible against the appellant.  Incidentally, there were good reasons for doubting the truth of the statement, which was inconsistent  with what he is alleged to have told the prosecution witnesses and was repudiated by him at his trial.  Page 405 of [1974] 1 EA 402 (CAK)  There was a further matter on which the judge relied. The wife of the appellant, Perusi Tibyonza, gave  evidence to the effect that the deceased woman, Zabina, had accused the appellant of stealing her hen and  that Zabina had performed an act of witchcraft, following which a child of the appellant had died. The  judge regarded this as evidence of motive.  During the course of the examination in chief of Perusi, the state attorney applied for and was granted  leave to treat her as a hostile witness. Later, in the course of his judgment, he said that he had ruled that  the evidence given by Perusi before she was declared a hostile witness could be considered and relied on.  With respect, this is a serious misdirection. The judge quoted a passage from Halsburys Laws of  England, but this passage does not relate to witnesses declared hostile but to the position where a party  contradicts part of the evidence of his own witness. The giving of leave to treat a witness as hostile is  equivalent to a finding that the witness is unreliable. It enables the party calling the witness to  cross-examine him and destroy his evidence. If a witness is unreliable, none of his evidence can be relied  on, whether given before or after he was treated as hostile, and it can be given little, if any, weight (see  Alowo v. Republic, [1972] E.A. 324). The rule of practice is based on logic, because if a person is found  to be untruthful, there is no reason to suppose that he was any more truthful before he was caught out  than after: indeed it is the very evidence that he has given that has shown his unreliability. Here, the  application for leave to treat the witness as hostile appears to have been premature  there is no apparent  reason for it, appearing on the record  but it was made and allowed. It must be presumed that the  evidence she had given conflicted in some material respect from some earlier statement she had made.  In short, the only real evidence against the appellant was of his apparent knowledge of where the  bodies were to be found and this evidence was somewhat suspect. The judge found support for it in the  statement made to a magistrate by the co-accused, which was inadmissible against the appellant, and in  evidence of motive, which could not be trusted. For these reasons, we allowed the appeal.  Order accordingly.  For the appellant:  PS Ayigihugu  For the respondent:  JH Omondi (Principal State Attorney) and L Ogwang-Obote (State Attorney)
