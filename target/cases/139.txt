Editors Summary  In February 1997, the Appellant bank agreed to extend credit facilities in the nature of an overdraft  account and a loan account amounting to KShs 75 million to the Respondent company. The loans were  secured by a debenture dated 3 July 1997, charges covering several properties valued at KShs 77 million  at the material time, and personal guarantees by the companys directors to the extent of KShs 75 million  excluding interest. One of the terms of the debenture provided that if the company was unable to pay the  loans as demanded, the bank would, by notice in writing, be able to appoint a receiver and/or a manager  of the property and assets of the company. In February 1998, the company required a further injection of  cash and requested a further loan of KShs 10 million. The request was granted and the aggregate amount  of the loan  Page 53 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  facilities was increased to KShs 85 million for a temporary period running until 31 July 1998. The  company later fell into arrears of repayments and, on 18 October 1999, the bank recalled both facilities  by calling upon the company to pay a sum of KShs 88 402 412-32 by 1 November 1999. On 2 November  the bank wrote to the company and informed it that two persons were being appointed to act as joint  receiver/managers of the company. On 4 November 1999 the company filed suit against the bank seeking  a declaration that the appointment of the receivers was null and void and an injunction preventing the  bank from interfering with its operations. Simultaneously with the filing of the suit, the company sought,  inter alia, interim orders removing the receivers from the companys premises. The application was  granted on 25 January 2000 on the grounds that the appointment of the receivers would ground the  company and cause it irreparable damage. The bank appealed against the ruling. It was argued on its  behalf that the appointment of receivers had been necessitated by the fact that the companys assets were  allegedly being disposed of by its directors and also that the company, having requested and obtained the  loan facilities, was obliged to accept the consequences of the contract. The bank also claimed that the  principles governing the grant of interlocutory injunctions had not been applied correctly by the Judge.  The company for its part, contended that the bank had other substantial securities that it ought to have  realised instead of appointing receivers, that it had been making regular repayments of the loan and that it  had only fallen into arrears as a result of the high interest rates charged by the bank.  Held  (Shah JA dissenting) The real issue to be determined concerned the exercise of judicial discretion  in the granting of temporary injunctions and whether there was sufficient material before the Judge to  justify the grant in this instance. The conditions for the grant of an interlocutory injunction were (i) that  the Applicant had to show a prima facie case with a probability of success, (ii) the injunction would not  normally be granted unless the Applicant stood to suffer irreparable injury or loss which could not be  adequately compensated by an award of damages, and (iii) if the court was in doubt, the application  would be decided on the balance of convenience; Giella v Cassman Brown [1973] EA 358 followed. The  issue as to whether the interest was unconscionable or arbitrary was one to be dealt with at trial. An  appellate court would interfere with the lower courts discretion only if it had not been exercised  judicially; Mbogo v Shah [1968] EA 93 followed. Though a debenture holder had a right to appoint a  receiver and was under no duty to refrain from doing so if it might cause loss to the company, the court  had the power to interfere if there was no basis on which the right could be exercised or if it was being  exercised oppressively; Madhupaper International v Kerr [1985] LLR 2396 (CAK) and Nyaga v  Housing Finance Company of Kenya [1987] LLR 2187 (CAK) considered. There was nothing on the  record to show that the Judge had exercised his discretion improperly or misdirected himself on the  principles to be applied. The appeal would therefore be dismissed.

(3) That a mandatory injunction do issue compelling the alleged receiver Mr Vijay Chhotalal Malde and  Mr Subhash Chandra Girdharlal Devani to vacate the Plaintiff companys business premises with  immediate effect.  (4) .  The dispute herein is between Spares and Industries Limited (the Plaintiff in the superior court) and Fina  Bank Limited (the Defendant in the superior court).  Having been dissatisfied by the ruling of Mulwa J the Appellant, Fina Bank Limited (hereinafter  referred to as the Bank) now comes before this Court seeking an order that the said ruling be set aside.  Mr Fraser for the Appellant submitted that the Respondent asked for loan facilities and obtained the  same and hence it must accept the consequences of the contract.  In my view the dispute herein is the normal bank client relationship. Spares and Industries Limited  (herein referred to as the company) applied for loan facilities from the bank which request was granted  upon certain conditions  I would say usual bank-client conditions in transactions of this nature. The  loans designated as overdraft account and loan account were secured by a debenture dated 3 July  1997. In addition to the debenture the loan facilities were secured by a charge covering certain properties  and personal guarantees by the directors of the company. It would appear that the relationship between  the parties was good until 2 November 1999 when the bank wrote to the company demanding payment of  all the outstanding amounts failure to which the bank would appoint receivers under the terms of the  debenture. As a result of that  Page 55 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  letter, the company filed this suit against the bank. The main grounds upon which this suit was brought  were as follows:  1. The power contained in the debenture to appoint receivers had not become exercisable.  2. A ppointment of receivers will occasion the Plaintiff irreparable damages.  3. No true copies of the accounts were supplied to the Plaintiff.  4. T he appointment of the receivers was not made in good faith.  The Learned Judge of the superior court having considered all that was urged before him came to the  conclusion that the company was entitled to the orders sought in its chamber summons application. In his  ruling, the Learned Judge stated inter alia:  The appointment of the receiver in this case will no doubt have the effect of grounding the company. This is  unnecessary as the Bank can at the end of the day recover its money from the realisation of the securities it is  holding. The grounding of the company would have grave consequences which would constitute irreparable  damage to the company. I therefore find that under these circumstances an injunction should issue.  It should be pointed out that in this appeal it is that ruling on interlocutory application which is being  challenged. The issue is whether the decision by the Learned Judge was correct in view of the material  before him. If I understood Mr Frasers argument well, I think he was of the view that the principles or  conditions for the grant of interlocutory injunction as set out in Giella v Cassman Brown and Co Ltd  (1973) EA 358 were not followed. We know these conditions. First an applicant must show a prima facie  case with a probability of success. Secondly, an interlocutory injunction will not normally be granted  unless the applicant might otherwise suffer irreparable injury or loss which would not adequately be  compensated by an award of damages. And thirdly, if the court is in doubt, it will decide an application  on the balance of convenience. These should have been the guiding principles in this matter.  In his arguments before us, Mr Wagara stated that perusal of the accounts showed that every month  there was payment and that the company was asked to pay KShs 90 million within two hours. It was Mr  Wagaras contention that there was no justification in appointing the receivers.  It should be pointed out that in this appeal we are dealing with the interlocutory application which  was granted by the superior court. In the main suit, the company is challenging the appointment of  receivers and hence will be asking the superior court to declare that appointment illegal, null and void.  The issue of interest (as to whether it was unconscionable or arbitrary) will be dealt with during the main  trial. We cannot, in my humble view make any final conclusions on these issues as to do so would  amount to deciding the issues to be agitated in the main suit. In granting the interim injunction, the  Learned Judge was exercising judicial discretion. Facts were placed before him and he came to the  conclusion that an injunction was appropriate remedy albeit only temporary. In Giella v Cassman Brown  and Co Ltd (supra) Spry Vp stated (at 360D): I will begin by stating briefly the law as I understand it.  First the granting of an interim injunction is an exercise of judicial discretion and an appellate court will  not interfere unless it be shown that the discretion has not been exercised judicially (Sargent v Patel  (1949) 16 EACA 163).  Page 56 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  And in Mbogo and another v Shah (1968) EA 93 Sir Charles Newbold P put it thus:  [a] Court of Appeal should not interfere with the exercise of the discretion of a Judge unless it is satisfied  that the Judge in exercising his discretion has misdirected himself in some matter and as a result has arrived at  a wrong decision or unless it is manifest from the case as a whole that the Judge has been clearly wrong in the  exercise of his discretion and that as a result there has been misjustice.  In the present appeal the Learned Judge considered the state of accounts which was being disputed by the  company and was not in a position to make any final determination on this issue. Mr Wagara has argued  before us to the effect that the bank lumped all the accounts together and made a demand for  KShs 90 million. Mr Wagara pointed out that large payments had been made to the overdraft account but  the bank never took these payments into account. All these issues were raised in the superior court and it  was upon the Learned Judge to satisfy himself that a case for temporary injunction had been made. He  was not required to make a final finding on the issues as such finding can only be made after the  conclusion of the main suit.  In this judgment I would only confine myself to the issue of judicial discretion by the Learned Judge  and whether the material placed before him were sufficient for the grant of an injunction. The company  filed that chamber summons application in the superior court due to fears it sensed as a result of the  appointment of receiver by the bank. These fears were set out in the grounds in support of the  application. These grounds were as follows:  (a) That the purported appointment of a receiver and manager by the Defendant is premature and unlawful  as the power to appoint contained in the debenture has not become exercisable.  (b) The purported appointed receiver and manager are interfering with the business and trading of the  Plaintiffs company.  (c) The purported appointment of the receiver and manager will occasion the Plaintiff irreparable and  incalculable loss which cannot be adequately compensated in damages.  (d) The Plaintiff has not been supplied with a true account of its indebtedness by the Defendant.  (e) The alleged appointment of the receiver and manager is bona fide contested by the Plaintiff in this  suit.  Having considered the material placed before him the Learned Judge was satisfied that either all or some  of the above grounds had been proved and hence granted the injunction. In his view and relying on the  authority of In re Maskelyne British Typewriters Ltd [1898] 1 Ch 133 he thought that this was  appropriate case in which the court had to use it inherent power to intervene. The other reason why the  Learned Judge thought, that he had to interfere with the appointment of the receiver was that in his view  the power to appoint a receiver, was exercised oppressively and that there was no basis for doing so on  the part of the bank. In so doing the Learned Judge relied on the decision of this Court in Nyaga v  Housing Finance Co of Kenya [1987] LLR 2187 (CAK) in which this Court observed: Where a party  has a statutory right of action the court will not usually prevent that right being exercised except that the  court may interfere if there was no basis on which the right could be exercised or it was being exercised  oppressively.  Page 57 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  The Learned Judge also took into account the fact that a mandatory injunction could only be granted in  exceptional circumstances and in his view this case presented exceptional circumstances and hence he  went ahead and granted the mandatory injunction prayed for in the chamber summons application.  Having considered the material placed before the Learned Judge and having regard to the manner in  which he dealt with the issues can it be said that he was clearly wrong in exercise of his judicial  discretion? In my view, the Learned Judge cannot be faulted in his exercise of judicial discretion. It is my  view that the Learned Judge was perfectly entitled to grant the application. The arguments and authorities  cited in the course of the arguments by counsel before us would certainly be relevant during the hearing  of the main suit. Here, we are concerned with the narrow issue relating to the grant of interlocutory  injunction. Whether the appointment of receivers was null and void would be a matter to be agitated in  the main suit. I think that the balance of convenience dictated that a temporary injunction ought, to be  granted.  In view of the foregoing, I would dismiss this appeal, confirm and restore the order of the Learned  Judge made on 25 January 2000 and award costs of this appeal to the Respondent. I agree with the orders  proposed by Tunoi JA whose judgment I read in draft.  TUNOI JA: The main issue in this appeal is whether the right by the Appellant to appoint a receiver had  become exercisable under the terms of the debenture dated 3 July 1997, which was issued pursuant to the  agreement on credit facilities between the Appellant and the Respondent.  The Appellant, on or about 6 February 1997, agreed to grant to the Respondent a term loan of KShs  20 million and an overdraft of KShs 55 million. As security the Respondent would create in favour of the  Appellant firstly, legal charges over LR Numbers 209/3467, 209/3803, 37/724, 209/11894, 209/10544/16  and Kisumu Block 11/80 all valued at KShs 77 million; secondly, a debenture for KShs 75 million over  all the assets of the Respondent, and, thirdly, a joint and several guarantee for a similar sum by the two  directors of the Respondent company.  Both facilities attracted such rate of interest as the Appellant in its sole and absolute discretion may  decide from time to time but without any prior notice to the Respondent. Repayment was on demand but  the Respondent was initially allowed to liquidate the loan facility by 35 equal monthly instalments of  KShs 335 000 and a final instalment of KShs 8 275. Late payments would attract additional interest of  6% per annum over and above the reigning rate.  The debenture contained the usual power in favour of the debenture holder to appoint a receiver and  manager of the property charged, which was exercisable after the principal moneys became due and  payable by way of lawful demand. It is the Appellants case that the Respondent was indebted to the  Appellant in the sum of KShs 90 505 556-02. It made demand for immediate payment and on failing to  comply the Appellant exercised its power under the debenture and appointed two receivers and  managers. This appointment apparently galvanised the Respondent into action and it filed suit and  summons on 3 November 1999, claiming an injunction to restrain the Appellant from, inter alia, dealing  with or closing down the business and to compel the receivers and managers to vacate the premises.  The Respondent argued before Mulwa J that the appointment of the receivers had not become  exercisable and that their appointment would occasion the  Page 58 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  Respondent irreparable loss and damage. Moreover, it was averred, that no true copies of the accounts  detailing the loan had been supplied to the Respondent. It was further contended that the securities  securing the facilities outstrip the amount borrowed and that in any case they should have been sold  instead of resorting to the mover the Appellant did. The Respondent sought to show that it had been  making regular and constant payments and would have not been in arrears were it not for the exorbitant  rates from time to time reaching the peak rate of 37% per annum.  The Learned Judge held that the loss suffered by the Respondent was due to the interest rates and not  mismanagement. Only a year before receivership the Appellant had increased the loan facility and was  satisfied with the operations of the company. The Learned Judge held that the Appellant in appointing  the receiver exercised its power oppressively and without any basis. He held further that this was  tantamount to grounding of the operations of the Respondent. It was unnecessary as the Appellant could  at the end of the day recover its money from the realisation of the securities it is holding. It is from this  decision that this appeal was lodged.  This basis of the submissions of Mr Fraser, who appeared for the Appellant, was that a default under  the terms of the debenture had occurred and interest and its rate being the only issue in dispute between  the parties, the Learned Judge gravely misdirected himself in granting a mandatory injunction.  The Respondent concedes that it is now in arrears of several instalments but argues that the interest  rate the Applicant is charging is oppressive, was being increased at short intervals, and contract between  the parties the frequency of the increases make the Appellants action oppressive and inequitable.  Mr Fraser correctly pointed out that the relationship between the parties is based on contract and that  the appointment of receivers and managers is one of the contractual remedies available to the Appellant  for the Respondents default and the Appellant should not be hindered from exercising it without good  cause. He maintained that the Appellant is contractually entitled to appoint a receiver to protect its own  interest including the right to take possession of the affairs of the Respondents company.  The Learned Judge was of the view that the circumstances leading to the appointment of the receivers  attest to the contention that the mover was not for the benefit of the Respondent. Mr Fraser submits that  the Learned Judge was wrong. In Re Potters Oils Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 201 it was held that a debenture  holder who has a right to appoint a receiver is under no duty to refrain from exercising its rights because  doing so might cause loss to the company. This principle was applied by this Court in Madhupaper  International Ltd v Paddy Kerr and others [1985] LLR 2396 (CAK). Mr Fraser so far is right.  However, it is also correct law that where a party has a statutory right of action the court will not  usually prevent that right being exercised except that the court may interfere if there was no basis on  which the right could be exercised or it was being exercised oppressively. See Nyaga v Housing Finance  Co of Kenya [1987] LLR 2187 (CAK).  The Respondent contends that it had made substantial payments to the Appellant before the  appointment of the receiver and manager. It claims it had paid KShs 63 million. Further, it was engaged  in business as importers and distributors for industrial and agricultural machinery spares and general  hardware and  Page 59 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  has established an expensive network within the Republic of Kenya worth KShs 210 million. These  averments were not seriously challenged. This being an interlocutory appeal it is not possible for this  Court and the court below to resolve conflicts of evidence. The Respondents assertion may well be true.  If this is correct then the Learned Judge cannot be faulted when he held that the action taken by the  Appellant might not have been made in order to enable it to recover its money.  It is also clear from the statements of accounts that the Respondent was making repayments up to 2  November 1999, a day before the receivership, lending support to the observation by the Learned Judge  that there was no mismanagement on the part of the Respondent so as to warrant the appointment of the  receivers and managers.  I am of the view that the grounds of appeal canvassed by Mr Fraser require us to pronounce on  intricate and complicated points of law which have not had the benefit of adjudication by the Learned  Judge. Moreover, issues relating to repayments by the Respondent, mismanagement and securities cannot  be properly determined in this interlocutory appeal without the benefit of a trial.  The issue of receivership is an emotive one and I understand why the Respondent had to resort to  litigation. It destroys the business. It is expensive. The appointment of receivers and managers may not  necessarily improve the financial position of the business. These, in my view, are matters for  consideration as to whether to grant a temporary injunction or not. I am satisfied that all these  observations were in the mind of the Learned Judge when he accepted to the application for injunction.  Indeed he acted in accordance with the principles laid down in Giella v Cassman Brown and Co Ltd  [1973] EA 358 and came to the correct decision. I find no ground to fault him as he had exercised him  discretion correctly and judicially.  It is my view also that the Appellant had adequate security for its loans without replying on the  security given by the debenture. The allegation that they were either overvalued or undervalued was a  matter for trial.  The upshot of this is that I find no fault or misdirection in the ruling of the Learned Judge. I would  dismiss this appeal with costs. I would order that the receivers and managers appointed by the Appellant  do vacate the Respondents business premises forthwith. They are also restrained from interfering,  dealing with in any manner or closing down the Respondents business. They shall render accounts of the  business. This should be done within 30 days hereof. The superior court is directed to set down the  hearing of the suit on a priority basis.  As Okubasu JA agrees, these shall be the orders of the Court.  SHAH JA (DISSENTING): The Appellant, Fina Bank Limited (hereinafter referred to as the bank),  being dissatisfied with the ruling and the resultant order of the superior court (Mulwa J) delivered and  made on 25 January 2000, appeals to this Court against the whole of the said ruling. The Respondent,  Spares and Industries Limited (hereinafter referred to as the company), had raised monies from the  bank. The loans designated as overdraft account and loan account were secured, inter alia, by a  debenture (the debenture) dated 3 July 1997. The amount lent by the bank on the overdraft account was  KShs 20 000 000 whereas the amount agreed to be lent by the bank for the loan account was to reach up  to KShs 55 000 000.  Page 60 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  In addition to the debenture, the facilities are secured, firstly, by a first charge in favour of the bank  covering various properties, namely, LR Number 209/3467, LR Number 290/303, LR Number 37/7243,  LR Number 209/1194 and another property all valued at the material time, at KShs 77 000 000. The  debenture is a general debenture for KShs 75 000 000 in favour of the bank covering all assets of the  company. Additionally the directors of the company have executed joint and several personal guarantees  for repayment of the loans to the extent of KShs 75 000 000 excluding interest.  One of the terms of the debenture is that in the event of the company being unable to pay the loans as  demanded, the bank would by notice in writing appoint any person to be a receiver or receiver and  manager or receivers and managers of the property and assets of the company charged or agreed to be  charged. The modality of the appointment of receivers and managers is spelt out in clause 16 of the  debenture and clause 17 thereof spells out the powers of receivers and managers.  It appears that the company was in need of further injection of cash and by its letter dated 3 February  1998 the company requested of the bank a further loan of KShs 10 000 000 as to increase the aggregate  credit facility to KShs 85 000 000. The bank agreed to increase the extra facility sought for a temporary  period unto 31 July 1998. The loan account was reduced from KShs 20 000 000 to KShs 15 000 000 and  the overdraft account limit was increased to KShs 75 000 000. Despite the changes the aggregate amount  was increased, therefore, to KShs 85 000 000. I will revert to the terms of this further facility later.  The relevant terms of the credit facilities granted in 1997 and as set out in the banks letter of 6  February 2000 addressed to the company were as follows:  (a) Interest would be charged at such rate as the bank in its sole and absolute discretion may decide  from time to time. Such interest was to be computed on daily balances with monthly rates and  payable at the end of each month. The initial interest rate was 31% per annum but was subject to  change at any time without prior notice.  (b) The facilities were repayable on demand, but without prejudice to the banks right to recall the  facilities at any time, the bank agreed to allow the company to repay the loan account in 35  monthly installments of KShs 335 000 each and a final instalment of KShs 8 275 000.  (c) The facilities were subject to review every twelve months.  (d) In the event of delay or default in payment of interest or any repayment of principal on the  respective due dates interest would be charged at 6% extra on the amount in arrears from the due  date to the date of payment.  (e) The company accepted all the terms and conditions set out by the bank in its said letter of 6  February 1997. The said letter was signed by both the directors of the company. The company  made good its agreement to execute charges in favour of the bank over LR 2098/3467, LR  209/3803, LR 37/724, LR 209/11894 and LR 209/10544/16. The proposed charge over land parcel  number Block 11/80 Kisumu was not given on account of some technical hitch over the title to  Block 11/80 apparently resulting from delay over sub-division thereof. The charge over LR  209/8275/70 was executed after the agreement of 10 February 1998.  As pointed out earlier the agreement of 10 February 1998 catered for granting of extra but temporary  facilities in the sum of KShs 10 000 000 up to  Page 61 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  31 July 1998. The agreement of 10 February 1998 confirmed that the securities in favour of the bank  were those already executed, including the debenture. In addition Bando (K) Limited, a company  associated with the company, was to provide a corporate guarantee. The terms of repayment after  execution of the agreement dated 10 February 1998 were as follows:  Both facilities are repayable on demand. However without prejudice to our (the banks) right to recall the  facilities at any time we are agreeable to allow you to repay the term loan in successive monthly instalments  of KShs 670 000 each inclusive of interest beginning from next month. The overdraft facility is renewable  subject to annual review.  The parties also agreed then that the company would not avail itself of the overdraft facility of  KShs 15 000 000 from Victoria Commercial Bank Limited. The bank withdrew its consent to cede, pari  passu, the general debenture charge to Victoria Commercial Bank Limited so that the question of the  company seeking credit facilities from that other source was no more relevant.  The company, it appears, fell into arrears of repayments and the bank by its letter of 18 October 1999  recalled both the facilities. The bank called upon the company to pay a sum of KShs 88 402 412-32 by  1 November 1999 threatening to take legal steps against the company in the event of non-payment. The  guarantors were also informed of their liability to the bank in the event of non-payment.  Although according to the agreements between the parties the bank was not supposed to inform the  company of changes in the rates of interest the bank from time to time informed the company of  fluctuations in the rates of interest at time diminishing and at times increasing.  By its letter of 15 July 1998 the bank had drawn the companys attention to the repayment schedule  not being adhered to by the company. As at 14 July 1998, according to the bank the loan account had an  outstanding balance of KShs 15 055 914 and the overdraft account had an outstanding balance of  KShs 76 023 000-32. The bank demanded an immediate payment of KShs 7 000 000 to regularize the  accounts. By its letter of 3 September 1998 the bank again drew the companys attention to non-payment  of instalments and the exceeding of the overdraft limit. By its letter of 22 January 1999 the bank sought  confirmation from the company to the effect that as at 31 December 1998 the amount still outstanding the  loan account was KShs 17 822 779. The company confirmed that position as correct by counter-signing  that letter. By another letter of the same date the bank sought confirmation from the company to the  effect that the overdraft account as at 31 December 1998 amounted to KShs 64 147 652-82 in debit. The  company confirmed that position as correct by signing that letter also.  The bank, it appears, was earlier becoming concerned about the manner in which the company was  being run and sought explanation in that regard from the company by its letter of 6 August 1999. The  bank was concerned about diversion of working capital funds, outstanding debtors, use of proceeds of  sales and erosion of the capital base.  I revert to the letter of 18 October 1999 by which the bank recalled the facilities. The bank reminded  the company of the 18 October letter by its letter of 2 November 1999 and informed the company that it  was about to exercise its power to appoint receivers over all its properties, assets, undertakings and  Page 62 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  rights under the powers conferred upon the bank by the debenture and the bank appointed Messrs Vijay  Chhotal Malde and Subhash Chandra Girdharlal Devani as joint receivers and managers.  On 4 November 1999 the company filed suit in the superior court seeking, amongst other reliefs, a  declaration that the purported appointment of receivers is illegal null and void and also an injunction  restraining the bank, the receivers, their agents and servants from interfering with the companys business  operations and activities. Simultaneous to the filing of the suit the company lodged an application by  way of a chamber summons seeking orders to restrain the receiver/managers from interfering, dealing  with or closing down the companys business in any manner whatsoever until the hearing and final  determination of the suit. The company also sought an interim mandatory order for removal of the  receiver/managers from the companys premises. The application was certified as urgent by the superior  court and finally came up for hearing before Mulwa J on 16 December 1999. The application was  vigorously opposed. On 25 January 2000 Mulwa J allowed the companys application. He made the  following orders:  1. That the Defendant and its purportedly appointed receiver and manager (sic) Mr Vijay Chhotal Malde  and Mr Subhash Chandra Girdharilal Devani be and are hereby restrained whether by themselves,  agents, servants or otherwise howsoever from interfering, dealing with or closing down the Plaintiffs  business in any manner whatsoever until the hearing and final determination of this suit.  2. T hat a mandatory injunction be and is hereby issued compelling the alleged receiver (sic) Mr Vijay  Chhotalal Malde and Mr Subhash Chandra Girdharilal Devani to vacate the Plaintiff Companys  business premises with immediate effect.  3. T hat the costs shall be in the cause.  It is against these orders that the bank is appealing. For the purposes of this appeal it is relevant to point  out that the receiver/managers vacated the companys premises in obedience to the court order and the  bank applied to this Court for their reinstatement in the companys premises. That was by civil  application number 25 of 2000. This Court allowed the banks application and stayed the order of the  superior court granting the Respondent the said mandatory injunction pending the outcome of the banks  intended appeal against the company. This Court also reinstated the said receivers and managers. So the  situation now obtaining is that the company is being managed by the said receivers and managers.  At the hearing of this appeal Mr Fraser who appeared for the bank took the Court through the history  of the dealings between the parties leading up to the beginning of the litigation, which history I have  already set out. Mr Fraser pointed out that the company had admitted that the amounts due to the bank  were repayable on demand, and that there was no denial of indebtedness and that the company was  challenging the interest rates charged by the bank. Mr Fraser also pointed out that under the agreement  between the parties the bank was not obliged to give any notice to recall the loan before appointing  receivers and managers; nevertheless the bank did so by its letters of 18 October 1999 and 2 November  1999. The bank he argued, was concerned as it appeared to the bank that the assets of the company were  being eroded, directors were taking out the company monies and the companys liabilities were rising.  The banks concern was that the directors were allegedly milking all the  Page 63 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  companys resources and disposing of the assets. The companys trade creditors were on the increase.  There was no serious attempt to reduce the indebtedness and the payments being made were not  substantial enough. The debt, he urged, was admitted by way of confirmation to the banks auditors  which fact I have already alluded to.  It was pointed out that the company had agreed to pay, as shown in clause 2 of the debenture,  additional interest by way of penalty on all moneys and liabilities from time to time due or payable at  rates not exceeding the maximum permitted by law. It must be noted that the two letters of intent also  confirm this position. Mr Frasers argument on the issue of interest itself and the additional interest  charged by way of penalty resulting from non-payment of instalments was that there was no oppression;  that the company had knowingly entered into the contracts in question; that the rates of interest  fluctuating from time to time between 26% per annum to 34% per annum were within the normal rates  interest charged by the bank.  Mr Wagara appeared for the company in this Court. He also appeared for it in the superior court. The  companys argument in the superior court as pointed out by the Learned Judge was that the bank had  other substantial and sufficient securities exceeding the amounts borrowed and that the bank ought to  have sold the securities instead of appointing receiver/managers. The banks stand in the superior court  was parallel to the stand it took in this Court, that is to say that the financial position of the company  indicated, at the material time, that the company had been making considerable losses in its operation as  confirmed by the observations made in its balance sheet as at 30 November 1999 which observations  were based on the companys trading profit and loss accounts for the year 1998. The Learned Judge  appreciated the position and in that regard he said:  What is clear from these accounts is that the accumulation of interest on the borrowed money which in  1997/98 stood at KShs 41 127 million makes it impossible to service the loan with a gross profit of  KShs 15 262 million. These observations do not indicate mismanagement of the business on the part of the  Plaintiff (the Company) rather they show that the problem is interest rates. The Plaintiff has sought to show  that it was up to the time the receivers were appointed (was) making payments and that if it were not for the  interest rates it would have been up to date with its payments. In other words it is questioning the interest rates  charged by the Defendant (the Bank) but clause 2 of the debenture gives the power to charge interest at such  rates as the Bank may think fit. The debenture forms a contractual document between the parties and this  provision can only be changed or altered like any other contract under certain conditions. In the absence of  any proof that this contractual relationship should be rescinded this provision for interest remains valid. As to  whether the right to appoint the receiver had become exercisable one has to turn again to the document which  has created the present relationship between the parties and that is the debenture clause 16 of the debenture  allows the Defendant the lender to appoint a receiver and or receiver manager when the security becomes  enforceable in case there is a breach of any of its conditions. In this case the default is based on the failure by  the Plaintiff to repay the loan when called upon to do so under clause 13 of the debenture which lists a  number of conditions if defaulted by the Plaintiff would entitle the calling up of the entire loan without  demand.  The Learned Judge correctly directed himself when he said that the relationship between the parties was  contractual and that unless that contract was rescinded it remained valid. The Learned Judge was also  right in thinking that the interest rates probably put the company in difficulties as regards the repayment  of the  Page 64 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  loans. But that is a moral issue. Parties are bound by the terms of their contract and it is not formally the  business of the court to spell out a contract other than the one in issue unless there are circumstances that  warrant recision of the contract. There is no suggestion by the company that the terms of the debenture  are not binding on it. The companys complaint is that the interest rates and penalty rate are onerous.  Having executed the debenture with full knowledge of the consequences following therefrom the  company cannot be heard to say that some of the terms thereof are onerous. That factor does not even  entitle the company (there is no such prayer) to avoid the debenture. Commercial transactions in this day  and age are entered into with full knowledge of the probable consequences. Lawyers are consulted before  such transactions are consummated and in this particular instance there is no suggestion that the bank had  exerted any undue influence on the company or its directors. It knew that it was borrowing huge sums of  money. It knew, also, that the loans carried interest payable along with repayment of the principal sums.  The company cannot be heard to say that the bank ought, first, to realize the other securities. It is for  the creditor to decide what mode to adopt for recovery of its dues or for protection of its interest. In  general a debtor cannot tell the creditor how the creditor ought to go about collecting its dues.  The Learned Judge having, at first, directed himself properly as already pointed out, misdirected  himself in concluding that the increased facility of KShs 10 000 000 granted by the bank to the company  indicated that the bank was happy with the performance of the company. The additional facility was a  temporary one and the letter of 10 February 1998 (earlier referred to) says so. As often happens in such  transactions and dealings, loan facilities are increased or decreased for business efficacy.  The Learned Judge also misdirected himself, in concluding that the company was making payments  up to 2 November 1999 confirming therefore that there was no mismanagement of the company as to  warrant the bank to take over management from the company. Mr Wagaras stand in this Court was  somewhat different. His argument was that the company was regularly paying the instalments on the loan  account and that the overdraft account was not in arrears. The loan account (number LN 4210) opened  with a debit entry of KShs 20 000 000 on 3 March 1997 and stood (in debit) at KShs 19 165 314 as at 2  November 1999. It shows that eight installments of KShs 670 000 each were paid by the company over a  period of 32 months in addition to some eleven payments of over KShs 800 000 each. The credit transfer  entry of KShs 1 317 203 on 16 February 1998 was not a payment. It was credited to the loan account and  debited to the overdraft account. If the repayments set out in clause 7 of the first letter of intent dated 6  February 1997 were adhered to, the loan account would have been in an extremely healthy state. Yet it  was not, as, obviously the repayments were erratic and irregular.  The overdraft account (number CC 1764) which started with a debit entry of KShs 800 on  28 February 1997 ended up with a debit figure of KShs 61 600 205-87. The overdraft account earmarked  at Industrial Area branch (number 474), opened on 1 July 1998 stood as at 5 November 1999, at a debit  figure of KShs 9 689 739-15.  Mr Wagara departed somewhat from his arguments as advanced before the superior court as well as  before this Court in civil application number 25 of  Page 65 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  2000. In this Court he emphasized that payments made by the company to the bank exceeded KShs 60  million as at the date of the appointment of receiver/managers. He argued that only a sum of KShs 30  million could be outstanding whereas the bank demanded a sum in excess of KShs 90 million. With  respect to Mr Wagara that is too simplistic a way of asserting that the bank had no right or business of  appointing the receiver/managers. It is common ground that the first facilities availed by the bank to the  company amounted to KShs 75 million. Taking interest thereon at the rate (say) of 30% per annum the  amount even on simple interest basis would come in three years, to KShs 150 million odd. Add to that  the further sum of Shs 10 million advanced in 1998. Payments amounting to KShs 60 million could in no  way, by any arithmetical calculations, be calculated to satisfy the debt.  As per calculations made by the companys own accountants, Messrs Ashwin Brothers, total interest  on the three amounts, as charged by the bank up to 1 November 1999 amounted to KShs 65 865 953.  They also show that the bank has charged in addition to the agreed interest, penalty rate interest, totaling  KShs 685 244. The dispute element can only relate to the penalty rate of interest charged as penalty is  generally challengeable.  I am afraid Mr Wagaras contention that the bank has charged exorbitant rates of interest does not  hold water. The company is bound by the rates of interest it agreed to pay. The transactions were  between a willing borrower and a willing lender and as already pointed out there is no suggestion of  coercion, fraud, undue influence etc.  Mr Wagara went further by arguing that in the face of the payments of approximately KShs 60 000  000 made by the company there was no justification for appointing receiver/managers; that it was not in  the interest of the bank to so appoint them; that the prevailing circumstances in the country do not justify  appointment of receiver/managers. These arguments are, again, too simplistic. There is no legal basis for  such arguments. The debenture gives the bank an unfettered right to appoint receiver/managers at any  time after the loan has become repayable. As the bank is contractually entitled to appoint  receiver/managers to protect its own interests it does not lie in the mouth of the company to say that the  appointment may not be beneficial to the bank. As between the company and the bank, the bank has the  right to take possession of the companys assets once the loan has become repayable. The bank is under  no duty to refrain from exercising its rights merely because to exercise them may cause loss to the  company or its unsecured creditors. The receiver/managers owe a duty of care to the company but this  duty is qualified by being subordinated to the protection of the banks interests. It was stated by Salmon  LJ in the case of Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd [1971] Ch 949 at 965H: If the  mortgagees interests, as he sees them, conflict with those of the mortgagor, the mortgagee can give  preference to his own interest.  It must be noted that the principle enunciated in the Cuckmere Brick Company case has been  consistently followed by our courts. For example see the case of Madhupaper International Ltd v Paddy  Kerr and others [1985] LLR 2396 (CAK). Mr Wagara invoked the equity jurisdiction of this Court by  his arguments as regards the high interest rates charged as a result whereof, he said, the company fell into  arrears. It is clear beyond peradventure that save for those special cases  Page 66 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  where equity might be prepared to relieve a party from a bad bargain, it is ordinarily no part of equitys  function to allow a party to escape from a bad bargain. Thus the jurisdiction of equity does not extend to  relieving a party from his contract when the nature of his mistake (assuming it be a mistake) went not to  the contracts subject matter or terms, but only to its commercial consequences and effect.  In this case the alleged onerousness of the interest rates (if it were indeed the case given the rates of  interest all banks in Kenya charge) related not to the terms of the contract but merely to its potential for  commercial exploitation. Such onerousness (if at all) cannot be characterized as a mistake or  misunderstanding relating to the subject matter of the contract (the debenture). What the company is  trying to do is to obtain release from what it calls high rates of interest calling such rates as oppressive.  What the Learned Judge did was to fall into a serious error by considering the matter before him from  the standpoint of a sympathiser. Whilst it is human to so feel, the function of the court is to enforce what  is agreed between the parties and not what the court thinks ought to have been fairly agreed between the  parties. I agree what was stated by Rimer J in the case of Clarion Ltd and others v National Provident  Institution [2000] 2 All ER 265 at 281J; he said:  The thrust of NPIs complaint is simply that is made a bad bargain from which it now wants to be released. It  is, however, of the essence of business transactions that each party is bargaining in his own interest and for his  own benefit and that each has to look after his own interests and that in most cases neither owes any duty of  care or disclosure to the other. It is inherent in such a system that there will he those who will make bad  bargains, but that is the risk which in my view each bargaining party must be assumed to be willing to take  and which the law must be regarded as having allocated to him.  The Learned Judge in my view, fell into error when he said that the appointment of the receivers in this  case was not for the benefit of the bank. When the right to appoint receiver/manager has crystallized it is  not for the court to decide for whose benefit such appointment is. At the risk of repetition I must say that  the court must leave parties to their bargain, good or bad.  The Learned Judge relied upon a passage in Halsburys Laws of England (3 ed) Volume 6 paragraph  969 to say that a power given in a debenture is fiduciary power and if not made for the benefit of the  debenture holders but with a view to the benefit of the company or third persons the court will interfere  and appoint its own receiver. What the Learned Judge missed out was that the paragraph (969) refers to  power given for appointment of a receiver in debenture of a series.  In the end result and without going to all grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the bank, I would  allow this appeal and set aside the orders made by the superior court on 25 January 2000. I would  confirm the orders for the re-entry of the receiver/managers into the premises of the company as made by  this Court in civil application number 25 of 2000. The receiver/managers will act in accordance with the  terms of the debenture. I would grant to the Appellant the costs of this appeal as well as costs of the  companys application in the superior court dated 3 November 1999 and lodged on 4 November 1999.  Page 67 of [2000] 1 EA 52 (CAK)  As this litigation involves substantial sums of money and as some pertinent issues are raised I think it  would be in the interests of both parties to bring on the suit for trial at the earliest possible date.  For the Appellant:  K A Fraser instructed by Hamilton Harrison and Mathews  For the Respondent:  J O Wagara instructed by Makhecha and Co  Gachiengo
