Wamiko Construction Co. (U) Ltd Applicant

Versus

Trans Action International Ltd Respondent


Application seeking leave to appear and defend-Contract-Breach of contract.
Brief facts:
On 17th Day of March, 2004, the applicant subcontracted the respondent to
carry out certain works. These works were not completed as agreed upon in
the contract. And that this none-completion amounted to a breach of the
contract by the respondent, resulting in the owner of the works, refusing
to pay the applicant, who was the main contractor. It was therefore
contended that there are triable issues of fact and law.
Issues:
Whether there was a triable issue of fact or law arising on the pleadings
and evidence.
Held:
Application for leave to appear and defend dismissed with costs as without
merit. Judgment is entered for the respondent in the sum of US$ 95,021.22
as prayed for by the respondent with costs of the suit.

            Before: The Honourable Mr. Justice FMS Egonda-Ntende

                                   Ruling
1. This is an application by Wamiko Construction Co. (U) Ltd, hereinafter
referred to as the applicant, seeking leave to appear and defend the head
suit. It is supported by two affidavits sworn by Mr. Alex Rezida, the
Receiver of the applicant.
2. This application is opposed by the respondent and an affidavit in reply
sworn by Mr. Kassami, the Managing Director of the respondent was filed in
support thereof.
3. The application puts forth the following ground for the application.
That on 17th Day of March, 2004, the applicant subcontracted the respondent
to carry out certain works. These works were not completed as agreed upon
in the contract. And that this none-completion amounted to a breach of the
contract by the respondent, resulting in the owner of the works, refusing
to pay the applicant, who was the main contractor. It is therefore
contended that there are triable issues of fact and law.
4. Mr. Alex Rezida in his supplementary affidavit, filed without leave of
this court, stated at paragraph 5, 'That the respondent/plaintiff did not
receive payment for the construction work since they did not complete the
external works as specified in the building contract and the breach caused
by them resulted in the withholding of payments and levying of penalties.'
5. In the earlier affidavit Mr. Alex Rezida had inter alia stated, '7. That
the plaintiff only completed two components of the construction (and
defaulted on technical specifications) that is the office and warehouse
buildings without carrying out the external works.
6. In answer to the case put forth by the applicant, the respondent in the
affidavit of Mr. Kassami stated, that the contract agreed had contained
three components, office, warehouse and external works. He asserted that
they completed the office and warehouse but were stopped from continuing
with the external works by the applicant. This variation was contained in a
letter from the applicant to the respondent dated 19th October 2004. I
shall set it out in full.
'Our Ref: UG/264/AL/4009 19th October 2004 Transaction International (U)
Ltd P.O. Box 6002 Dear Sir, RE: CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE AND WAREHOUSE AT
ENHAS Reference is made to the Sub Contract agreement we signed with you on
the 7th March 2004 to undertake Civil works for office warehouse and
external works for the above project. Following discussions held with you
we have decided to exclude the external works from your contract. We have
also omitted some works from Office and Warehouse as you are aware. We
would now request you to make a revised claim as per our signed Contract
and variation with other claims separately. Yours faithfully, for Wamiko
Construction company (U) Ltd. ANDREAS LYBAERT CHAIRMAN.'
7. It is clear from the foregoing that the external works that the
applicant contends the respondent did not execute were excluded from the
contract by the applicant as of 19 October 2004. To claim now that the
respondent failed to execute those external works is patently false as this
obligation had been removed from him. The claim of default on technical
specifications made in Para 7 of Mr. Rezida's first affidavit is totally
devoid of any meaning. No particulars are provided whatsoever. No regard
can be taken of it.
8. In fact a final account between the parties was done by the applicant.
It is annexed to the plaint. It has not been denied or put in issue. The
applicant in that final account certifies that US$125,021.22 was due to the
respondents. This note is signed by officials of the applicant. In
addition, the applicants, by their Managing Director, a certain Mr. Karl
Wipfler, wrote on 19th July 2005, to a Mr. Phillip Curtin, acknowledging
indebtness to the respondent in the sum claimed in the plaint, among
others, and requesting that payment be effected directly to the respondent
and other affected parties. No claim is made against the respondents by the
applicant by way of set off or counter claim.
9. Mr. Kassami in his affidavit stated that since filing this suit, the
applicant paid to the respondent, part payment of US$30,000.00 and that
this accordingly reduces their claim on the applicant.
10. The law with regard to applications of this nature is fairly
established. The applicant will have discharged the burden upon it, in an
application of this nature, when it shows it appears to have a good
defence, or that there is a triable issue of fact or law arising on the
pleadings and evidence. See Hasmani v Banque du Congo Belge (1938) 5 EACA
88, Toro & Mityana Tea Co. Ltd v Ibingira Charles HCCA No. 11 of 1995
(unreported). Nevertheless the application of this principle is not without
trouble.
11. The words of Sir Graham Paul, V-P, in Churanjila and Co v A. H. Adam
(1) (1950) 17 EACA 92, at Page 92 easily come to mind. He stated,
"There is no difficulty about the principles to be applied in deciding this
appeal. The law on the point is clear and only its application to the facts
gives any trouble. It is desirable and important that the time of creditors
and of Courts should not be wasted by the investigation of bogus defences.
That is one important matter but it is a matter of adjectival law only,
embodied in the Rules of Court, and cannot be allowed to prevail over the
fundamental principle of justice that a defendant who has a stateable and
arguable defence must be given the opportunity to state it and argue it
before the Court. All the defendant has to show is that there is a definite
triable issue of fact or law."
12. I have carefully reviewed the affidavits filed in this case with all
annextures, and I am satisfied that the sum claimed in the plaint is truly
due and owing to the respondent from the applicant. There is no defence
disclosed on this application against this claim. The allegations of breach
of contract for none execution of the external works are patently false.
And if they had any substance it would raise only a possible counter-claim
and or set-off against the respondent.
13. The applicant raises by way of the supplementary affidavit that it
received a claim for liquidated and ascertained damages from the owner of
the buildings recently. No information is provided to show that this
relates to the works carried out by the respondent or those the respondent
was excluded from carrying out. No connection or link is therefore drawn
between this claim and the respondent at this stage. It cannot be used to
defeat the respondent's claim. The applicant is of course at liberty to
file a separate suit and pursue that claim, if it wishes. It is no bar to
judgement being entered for the respondent in the head suit.
14. In the result I dismiss this application for leave to appear and defend
with costs as without merit. Judgment is entered for the respondent in the
sum of US$ 95,021.22 as prayed for by the respondent with costs of the
suit.

Dated, signed and delivered this 7th day of December 2005
