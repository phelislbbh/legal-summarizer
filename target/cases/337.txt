Editors Summary  The Appellant filed suit against the Respondent seeking damages for injuries sustained in an accident that allegedly occurred while he was travelling as a fare-paying passenger in the Respondents vehicle. The plaint averred that the accident occurred on 7 December 1992 when the driver of the Respondents motor vehicle registration number KAC 641H drove the vehicle in a negligent manner causing it to leave the road, hit a tree and plunge into a river. The Respondents defence admitted the occurrence of an accident but averred that the vehicle involved had a registration number KAC 642H and denied that the Appellant was a passenger therein. The Appellant, who was the sole witness at the trial, narrated how the accident occurred, described the injuries he sustained and produced medical evidence and a police abstract showing not only that an accident involving motor vehicle registration number KAC 642H occurred on 7 December 1992 but also that he was a passenger on the vehicle. The trial Judge dismissed the suit on the grounds, inter alia, that the Appellants failure to produce a fare receipt made his oral evidence that he was a passenger unbelievable, that the Appellants failure to join the driver was fatal to the claim and that the Appellants evidence regarding speed was mere opinion. On appeal, the Appellant challenged the trial Courts findings of fact and conclusion that the failure to join the driver to the suit was fatal.     Held  The variance in the particulars of the motor vehicle prejudiced neither party and should not have a bearing on the outcome of the appeal. Failure to join a driver in a damages claim against his employer was not fatal as the employers liability largely depended on the pleadings and the evidence in support of the claim: Selle and another v Associated Motor Boat Co Ltd and others [1968] EA 123 and Mwonia v Kakuzi Ltd [1982] LLR 46 (CAK) applied; Athman v Garissa County Council Nairobi HCCC number 2484 of 1992 overruled. The circumstances surrounding the accident supported the Appellants evidence and showed that the driver was not in control of the vehicle hence the trial Judge erred in finding otherwise. Though a fare receipt was evidence of a person being a passenger in a particular motor vehicle, it was not the only such evidence and in this instance the police abstract and the Appellants oral testimony clearly established his status as a passenger on the motor vehicle at the material time. The trial Judge therefore erred in finding to the contrary. The appeal would be allowed.

In his amended plaint he averred, inter alia, that on the material date of the accident he was a  fare-paying passenger in a motor vehicle registration number KAC 641H then owned by the Respondent  which was heading to Kitui; that the driver of the motor vehicle was a servant or agent of the  Respondent; and that his driving was negligent in that he was driving the vehicle too fast as a result of  which he did not exercise or maintain sufficient control of it, whereupon it left the road along which it  was being driven, hit a tree, overturned and fell into river Kituagathini. The Appellant was seriously  injured.  In a very short written statement of defence, the Respondent admitted the accident, but averred that  the motor vehicle concerned was KAC 642H not KAC 641H and that the accident was inevitable, but  denied the Appellant was a passenger therein or that he suffered any injuries. No issue was raised  regarding the competence of the suit due to the failure by the Appellant to join the driver of the accident  motor vehicle as a party in the suit.  Only the Plaintiff testified. His evidence was that he was a fare-paying passenger in the Respondents  bus, registration number KAC 641H, on 7 December 1992, while travelling to Kitui along the  Machakos-Kitui road. It was being driven very fast. As it approached a certain river and while being  driven downhill he heard some passengers at the rear part of the bus screaming and soon thereafter the  motor vehicle hit a tree off the road, overturned and fell into the river. He said that the bus was  overloaded and because of that he was unable to see the driver from where he was seated. As a result of  the impact several standing passengers fell on him one of whom bit his left ear lobe tearing it before that  other passenger died. Apart from the cut ear lobe, the Appellant said that he suffered a fracture of the  right ulna and radius, and a bruised back. He produced medical evidence to prove the extent of the  injuries, and also a police abstract report to show not only that an accident involving motor vehicle  registration number KAC 642H occurred on 7 December 1992, along the Machakos-Kitui road, but also  that he was a passenger therein.  Page 464 of [2000] 2 EA 462 (CAK)  Notwithstanding that the Appellants evidence was uncontroverted, Mwera J did not think that the  Appellant established by evidence that he was a passenger in the accident motor vehicle or that he  established negligence against the Respondents driver. It was his view that the failure by the Appellant  to produce a fare receipt made his oral evidence that he was a passenger in the motor vehicle,  unbelievable. The Learned Judge was also of the view, although he did not explicitly say so, that the  failure of the Appellant to join the driver of the fateful bus was fatal to the Appellants claim. On the  issue of negligence the Learned Judge held that the Appellants evidence regarding the speed of the bus  was merely an opinion. On the basis of those findings he dismissed the Appellants claim and thereby  provoked this appeal.  The memorandum of appeal contains eight grounds which, except the one on the non-joinder of the  driver, challenge the aforesaid findings of fact. We propose to deal first with the particulars of the  accident motor vehicle before we go into the issues raised by the appeal itself. According to the amended  plaint the accident motor vehicle was a bus registration number KAC 641H. The written statement of  defence gives the registration particulars as KAC 642H. Although that was so no issue was framed  thereon for the courts determination. The parties proceeded with the case, prima facie, on the basis that  whether it was motor vehicle KAC 641H or KAC 642H the accident motor vehicle was owned by the  Respondent. Neither party was thus prejudiced and we do not think that in the circumstances, the  variance in the particulars of the said motor vehicle should have any bearing on the outcome of this  appeal.  As we stated earlier, the Appellant did not sue the driver of the accident motor vehicle. In Omar  Athman v Garissa County Council Nairobi High Court civil case number 2484 of 1992 (UR) which the  trial Judge cited in his judgment but did not make any comments on, Aganyanya J struck out the  Plaintiffs suit for incompetence because the driver of a motor vehicle in a running-down defended suit  was not made a party in the suit. In his view the liability against the owner of the vehicle in such a case  being vicarious is dependent on a decree against his driver on the same facts.  In Selle and Another v Associated Motor Boat Company Ltd and others [1968] EA 123, the  respondents who owned and maintained a boat involved in an accident in which one of the appellants  was injured, were held vicariously liable for their drivers negligence even though the said driver was not  a party in the suit. Likewise in Mwonia v Kakuzi Ltd [1982] 46 (CAK), the Respondent was held liable  for its drivers negligence although the driver was neither made a party nor did he testify in the case  against his employer. Chesoni and Nyarangi A JJA (Kneller JA dissenting, but not for the reason that the  driver was not joined) held that on the basis of the evidence before the court the respondent as owner of  the accident motor vehicle was liable to the appellant in damages for the proved negligence of its driver.  From the authorities it would appear to us that the mere fact that the driver of an accident motor  vehicle is not joined in a damages claim against his employer arising from his driving is not fatal.  Liability against the employer largely depends on the pleadings and the evidence in support of the claim.  Vicarious liability of the employer is not pegged to the employees liability but to his negligence. Having  come to that conclusion we are unable to agree with Aganyanya J that the non-joinder of the driver in an  action such as the one which gave rise to this appeal renders that suit incompetent.  Page 465 of [2000] 2 EA 462 (CAK)  Turning now to the evidence, the Learned trial Judge did not attach much weight to the Appellants  oral testimony regarding the cause of the accident upon which his claim was based. This is what he said  in regard thereto:  The Plaintiff sat at the back of the bus. He did not say whether he was a driver himself but he was of the  opinion that the bus was being driven fast and so passengers screamed. That remains an opinion. It ought to  be proved by evidence that as a fact the driver was going at a high speed and in the circumstances that was  negligent. That was not done here.  With respect to the Learned Judge, apart from the general statement by the Appellant that the bus was  being driven too fast there were co-existing circumstances which made the Appellants statement to be  more than a mere opinion. The other passengers in the bus screamed before the bus left the road, hit a  tree and overturned before it plunged into a river. There is also uncontroverted evidence that the bus was  going downhill. Each of the facts taken alone might not establish negligence. However when taken  together and also the fact that the bus eventually hit a tree, overturned and eventually fell into a river,  they show that the bus driver did not have proper control of it, probably due to high speed. Mr Chacha  Odera for the Respondent conceded this, and further that the evidence on record clearly established  negligence on the part of the Respondents driver, quite properly and commendably so. The Learned trial  Judge in our view, fell into grave error when he found otherwise.  As to whether the Appellant was a passenger in an accident bus, the police visited the scene of the  accident, and later prepared the abstract report of it. The Appellant produced a copy of the report in  evidence, and no evidence was adduced to controvert it. The Appellant is shown in that report to have  been one of the passengers in the accident bus. The Learned trial Judge did not advert to this evidence.  He appears to have thought that because the Appellant had averred in his amended plaint that he was a  fare-paying passenger, his failure to produce the fare receipt he was issued was evidence that he was not  a passenger in the bus at the time of the accident. Such a receipt is evidence but not the only evidence in  proof of the Appellant, or any other person, being a passenger in a particular motor vehicle. In the case  before us, the police abstract report on the accident and the Appellants oral testimony clearly established  that the Appellant was a passenger in the accident bus on the date and time of the subject accident. The  finding by the Learned trial Judge to the contrary is clearly in error in view of that evidence.  Having come to the foregoing conclusions, it is our view that the dismissal of the Appellants case  was clearly unjustified.  As regards quantum of damages the Learned Judge said that he would have considered an award  something in the region of KShs 250 000 in damages, notwithstanding that the Respondents counsel  had proposed a figure of KShs 300 000. Considering the manner in which the Learned Judge couched his  language the sum of KShs 250 000 was not definite. In the circumstances we are free to fix what we  consider to be a reasonable award. On the facts and circumstances of this case we consider KShs 300 000  as a reasonable figure on the head of general damages. The Appellant gave evidence that he spent KShs 1  000 to obtain a medical report on his injuries and produced a receipt for the payment. He also stated that  he paid KShs 100 for the police abstract report on his accident and produced a receipt in support. He had  pleaded both items in his amended plaint and we are of the view that he is entitled to them.  Page 466 of [2000] 2 EA 462 (CAK)  In the result and for the foregoing reasons we allow the Appellants appeal, set aside the trial courts  order dismissing his suit with costs and substitute therefor a judgment in his favour for KShs1 100  special damages, and KShs 300 000 general damages with costs and interest both here and in the court  below.
