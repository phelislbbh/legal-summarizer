COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION

HCT-00-CC-MA-0654-2006

(Arising from HCT-00-CC-CS-0245-1999)

Argus Construction & Joinery Ltd
Applicant

Versus

Attorney General
     Respondent

Legislation referred to:
The Civil Procedure (Amendment) (Judicial Review) Rules, S.I. 75 of 2003.

BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The applicant was the successful party in the suit, and is now the judgment
creditor in respect of a decretal sum of shs.20, 579,751.00, interest at
the rate of 12 per cent annum from March 1999 till payment in full and the
costs of the suit, taxed and allowed at Shs.12, 661,000.00. The applicant
now seeks an order of Mandamus directing the Commissioner/Treasury Officer
of Accounts to comply with the decree of this court by paying all the
monies due to the applicant there under.
The respondent did not oppose this application. At the hearing of this
application Ms Fatuma Nanziri, the learned state attorney, representing the
Attorney General stated,
           'I do not object to the application. Apparently this case has
           been listed as 118 in the priority list. It is just that funds
           have not been availed but the same has been listed for payment
           in this quota. What we need is more time to enable government
           get the funds.'
Asked as to how much time Government needed to pay, Ms Nanziri was unable
to give any idea about the time Government needed to be able to pay.
As this application is not opposed, I am satisfied that this is an
appropriate case in which this court should issue an Order of Mandamus,
directing the Commissioner/Treasury Officer of Accounts of Government of
Uganda to pay without further delay, the decretal sums of money due to the
applicant, which have remained outstanding since the decree was entered in
this suit. Accordingly the application is allowed.
The Commissioner/Treasury Officer of Accounts is ordered to pay the
decretal sums, interest and costs as allowed by the court, forthwith, and
without further or any delay. I further direct that the Attorney General
shall meet the costs of these present proceedings.
Before I take leave of this matter I must turn to another matter that was
raised by Ms Fatuma Nanziri, the learned State Attorney, at the hearing of
this application. Ms Fatuma Nanziri raised a preliminary objection that
this application was time barred. I dismissed the objection, and promised
to give my reasons in this ruling, and I now do.
Ms Fatuma Nanziri, learned state attorney, for the Attorney General,
submitted that this application was time barred, contrary to Rule 5(1) of
The Civil Procedure (Amendment) (Judicial Review) Rules, S.I. 75 of 2003.
She submitted that the decree in this case was extracted in October 2002,
and that time started to run then, which was more than the 3 months allowed
under Rule 5(1) of the Rules aforesaid. Ms Nanziri prayed that this
application should therefore be struck out.
Ms Nanziri referred this court to what she called a decision of this court,
in Rwomushana v Attorney General. She provided no other particulars of the
case. Obviously it is unreported, or must be presumed unreported as no
citation was provided. No case number was provided. In short, counsel was
hardly helpful.
Mr. Bakwega, learned counsel for the judgment creditor/applicant, opposed
the preliminary objection. He submitted that in terms of the Government
Proceedings Act, Section 19, a judgment creditor must obtain a certificate
of order against government, in order to be able to initiate proceedings to
compel government to comply with a decree. The certificate was obtained
only on 19th May 2006, and time does not start to run until then. These
proceedings were commenced only on 12th July 2006, less than 3 months from
the issue of a certificate of order against government. The proceedings
were therefore within time.
I take the view that the reference to 'when the grounds of the application
first arose' to refer, not to the date of the decree or for that matter the
date of issue of the certificate of order against government, but refers to
when the applicant is satisfied that the officer in question, will not obey
the certificate of order against government. This may well be long after
the issue of a certificate of order against government. It is only after
the applicant determines that the officer in question is not going to
comply with the order that time will start to run. In this case this could
only have happened after the issue of the certificate of order against
government. As proceedings were brought in less than 3 months from the date
of issue of the certificate of order against government, I was satisfied
that this application was not time barred.
Signed, dated and delivered this 2nd day of November 2006
