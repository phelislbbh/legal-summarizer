                                 - VERSUS -

UGANDA COMMERCIAL BANK LTD ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: DEFENDANT
BEFORE:  HON. MR  JUSTICE RUBBY AWERI OPIO
J  U  D  G  M  E  N  T:-
The plaintiff sued  the  defendant  for  among  other  claims,  damages  for
wrongful termination of service,  special  damages  by  way  of  payment  of
terminal benefits, exemplary damages and interest on the damages and costs.

The brief facts giving rise to the cause of action are  that  the  plaintiff
was appointed in the employment of the defendant on the 15th July 1979.   He
served in various departments of the bank until 21st September 1999 when  at
the instance of the bank he was arrested  and  detained  at  Kawempe  police
station.  He was arrested because of the loss of some US $200.000 which  had
been collected form Kasese branch and handed to two officers  of  the  bank.
He was released on bond on 27th September 1999 but kept on  reporting  at  a
police post  at  the  defendant's  head  office  premises  in  Kampala.   He
appeared before the Staff Commendation and  Disciplinary  Committee  between
January and March 2000 on allegation of the loss of  the  said  money.   The
committee exonerated him but was however terminated on the 12th  June  2000.
The other two suspects were however dismissed from service.   The  plaintiff
appealed to the defendant against the termination but he  was  turned  down.
He later lodged a complaint with the office  of  the  Inspector  General  of
Government  against  unlawful  termination.   The   said   office   strongly
recommended that the plaintiff should be paid one-year's salary like he  had
been  declared  redundant.   The  defendant  however  decided  to  pay   the
plaintiff another two months out of which the defendant  deducted  what  the
plaintiff owed to the defendant before his termination.  Hence this suit.




The defendant denied the plaintiff's claim by  stating  that  the  plaintiff
was rightfully terminated in accordance with the  terms  and  conditions  of
employment and further that the bank had an inalienable right  to  hire  and
fire.  The defendant insisted that upon his termination, the  plaintiff  was
paid in accordance with the law.




During scheduling conference, the following issues were agreed:-

 1) Whether the plaintiff's dismissal was lawful and/or justified.
 2) Whether the arrest and detention of the plaintiff at the instance of the
    defendant of the defendant was legal and/or justifiable.
 3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the claim for exemplary/punitive
    damages.
 4) What remedies if any, are available to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff testified alone while the defendant called one witness one
Alfred Oder Ogang (DW1).

The plaintiff Abbas Sendagala (PW1) gave a detailed account of  his  service
history with the defendant bank from  15/7/1979  to  12/6/2000.   He  stated
that he entered the plaintiff's employment on 15th July 1979 as a  messenger
(exhibit P1).  Soon after that appointment,  he  went  for  a  course  which
resulted in another appointment in April 1981 as a  clerk/machine  operator.
He was then posted to Masaka Branch where he stayed up to 1989 when  he  was
transferred to Kyotera after being promoted to Supervisor.  From Kyotera  he
was transferred to Lukaya where he was  promoted  to  the  rank  of  banking
officer in 1991.  That same year he was made the  Branch  manager  Kalangala
up-to 1995.

In 1995 he was transferred to Namasuba, still as  Branch  Manager  where  he
stayed for four months and was transferred to a  bigger  branch  at  Kawempe
where he was made second in-charge.  In  1996  he  was  transferred  to  the
Headquarters  International  Division  where  he  was   put   in-charge   of
reconciliation and investments.  His duties were to reconcile  International
Division and other branches of the bank.  He  was  further  responsible  for
foreign cash movements of foreign currencies imported into the  country  and
that collected by the Bank's local branches.  He testified that he  was  the
only officer holding a Civil Aviation Card which  authorized  him  alone  to
receive foreign currency at Entebbe Airport when brought into  the  country,
and to transport it to International Division.  He related that the  biggest
single cash importation he handled in line with his duties was US $  800.000
which he safely deposited at  International  Division.   He  worked  in  the
above Division from August 1996 up-to December 1999 when he was  transferred
to the Real Estate Department of  the  same  bank.   The  transfer  to  Real
Estates followed the loss of US $200.000.

About the  loss  of  US  $200.000  the  plaintiff  testified  that  on  15th
September 1999 he left the Head office to collect cash dollars  from  Kasese
and Mbarara Branch.  He came back with over 250.000 US $.  He reported  back
on 16th September 1999 and handed over the cash to the  officer's  in-charge
foreign cash called Vincent Kalika and Tumutegyereize.  After  counting  and
verifying the cash the above two signed on the delivery book.

After that the general manager in-charge of  the  Division  Nocholas  Okello
also signed on a receipt in acknowledgement  of  the  same.   After  handing
over the money he left for his home.  The next day which was  Friday  was  a
normal working day.  He reported for duties as usual.  The Monday  following
was not a working day.  So he reported on duty on Tuesday  where  he  learnt
from the key holders that the money he had given them had  got  stolen  from
the safe.  The two officers were thereafter arrested.
The plaintiff testified that after the arrest of the  two  officers  he  was
also arrested and his home was searched but nothing was recovered.   He  was
later taken to Kawempe Police Station where he  spent  seven  days.   During
the time he was in police custody at Kawempe he was not  mistreated  but  he
suffered a lot of trauma and his family spent a lot of  money  visiting  him
in the cells.  He also suffered embarrassment at the hand of his  neighbours
who were present during the house search because he was  believed  to  be  a
honest person.  He was later on released on police bond while the other  two
officers were taken to court.  He  kept  on  reporting  every  week  to  CID
Police Post located at the defendant's building for three months.  Two  days
after his final release from police bond he was summoned by Nicholas  Okello
to resume work at his old desk  and  with  the  same  duties.   After  three
months he was transferred to Real  Estates  Department.   He  insisted  that
after handing over the cash to the two senior officers above him, he had  no
control over it as his role ended after  collecting  and  handing  over  the
same.

The plaintiff testified that in April  2000  he  was  called  by  the  staff
commendation and Disciplinary Committee to explain his  involvement  in  the
lost dollars.  The Committee wrote a report (exhibit  P2)  which  exonerated
him.  After that he continued working in Real Estates until 12th  June  2000
when he received a letter terminating his  services  (exhibit  P10).   After
his termination he appealed to the Managing Director (MD) to complain  about
his termination (exhibit P3).  The  Managing  Director  wrote  back  turning
down the appeal (exhibit P4).  After that  the  plaintiff  resorted  to  the
office of the Inspector General of Government.   The  Inspector  General  of
Government took up the same and made his recommendation  (exhibit  P5)  that
he should be paid one year salary as compensation for  the  reason  that  he
was not involved in the loss of the dollars and that the plaintiff  was  not
given opportunity to defend himself.   He  stated  that  his  dismissal  was
contrary to the Policy Manual  (exhibit  P6).   The  plaintiff  stated  that
according to the nature of his termination he should have been  entitled  to
redundancy payment which was fifteen months'  salary  and  allowances  since
there was  no  reason  for  his  termination.   He  concluded  that  he  was
terminated as a result of malice and rumours.

Alfred Max Ogang Oder (DW1) who was  the  only  witness  for  the  defendant
testified that the plaintiff used to work for the defendant  before  he  was
terminated in accordance with his terms of  service.   He  stated  that  the
terms of service authorized termination of any of the defendant's  employees
after giving three months notice or cash  in  lieu  thereof.    Those  terms
were found in  the  Staff  Policies  Manual.   He  stated  that  before  the
plaintiff's termination something had taken place  in  that  the  bank  lost
cash dollars and other currencies at the International  Division  where  the
plaintiff was working.  That money which got lost had  been  transported  by
the plaintiff from other branches.  After handing  that  money  to  the  key
holders - Tumutegyereize and Sekanyike, the same got  lost.   The  defendant
then suspected the plaintiff and the two key holders  in  the  loss  of  the
said money.  The two key holders were  dismissed  while  the  plaintiff  was
terminated.  He stated that he was  involved  in  the  termination  exercise
since he was the Chairman Staff Commendation and Disciplinary Committee.

The committee recommended that the plaintiff be terminated.  The  report  of
the committee was marked exhibit D1.  After termination  the  plaintiff  was
paid in lieu of notice.  He stated that the  plaintiff  was  not  terminated
under Clause 8 (3) (a) of the Manual and that  notwithstanding  anything  in
the manual, the defendant could terminate under any  circumstances  such  as
if the bank felt uncomfortable to continue with one's  services  because  of
any suspicion and also when the bank does not want one's service  any  more.
He testified that the defendant relied on Clause 8 (3) (b) to terminate  the
plaintiff after considering that he was  lending  money  to  staff  although
this was not established as a fact by the committee and  that  there  was  a
strong suspicion that  the  plaintiff  was  involved  in  the  loss  of  the
dollars.  He concluded that the plaintiff's case could not lead  to  summary
dismissal.
Resolution of issues:-
1) whether the plaintiff's dismissal was lawful and/or justified.

The position of the law in  regard  to  termination  of  any  employee  from
employment with or without notice is now beyond any doubt.  The law is  that
an employer has the right to terminate the service of his  employee  at  any
time and for any reason or for none, provided that it is done in  accordance
with the law.  However before an employer can terminate he must follow  what
he agreed with the employee in the contract of service and in the rules  and
regulations governing the employment:  See Robinah  Sajjabi   Vs   UCB  C.S.
No. 560/96 (unreported).


In the instant case the plaintiff's services were terminated under Clause  8
(3) (b) because he was strongly suspected along two others for  causing  the
disappearance of dollars.  But this was a matter  which  was  subject  of  a
disciplinary proceedings where it was established  that  the  plaintiff  was
not connected with the loss of the said dollars.




The plaintiff has emphatic that after handing over the said dollars  to  the
two key holders, he had nothing to do with its  loss.   The  defendant  also
established that the plaintiff was not guilty in causing  the  loss  of  the
dollars.  Was it just and fair for the staff Commendation  and  Disciplinary
Committee to turn around and recommend the plaintiff's  termination  in  the
above manner?  In all fairness  I  do  not  agree.   I  find  this  kind  of
termination unnatural, unjust and contrary  to  the  rules  and  regulations
governing employment in this country.  It was done without  considering  the
number of good years the plaintiff  had  put  in  the  defendant's  service.
Surely a person who has  served  an  organization  for  about  20  years  in
various capacities should not have deserved the kind  of  termination  after
he was investigated and found to be  innocent.   Why  for  example  was  his
colleague who was also found  innocent  merely  cautioned?   For  the  above
reasons I find that the plaintiff's  termination  was  not  justified.   His
termination was not done with a human face.   It  was  very  oppressive  and
unreasonable.


Issue No. 2:-
Whether the arrest and detention of the plaintiff at the instance of the
defendant was legal and/or justified.

In the instant case the  arrest  and  detention  of  the  plaintiff  at  the
instance of the defendant was justified because the plaintiff was  suspected
in causing loss of the defendant's dollars.  The plaintiff was  one  of  the
suspects because he was the one who had brought the money  which  eventually
got stolen.  The defendant in my view was right  to  suspect  the  plaintiff
for the loss of public money.   In such a situation the defendant was  right
to  let  the  law  take  its  course.   The  arrest  and  detention  was  in
vindication of the law and  was  therefore  legal  and  justified.   It  was
connected to loss  of  public  money:   see  Abraham  Waligo   Vs   Attorney
General HCCS 533/94 (unreported).

Issue No. 3:-
Whether the  plaintiff  is  entitled  to  the  claim  of  exemplary/punitive
damages.
The plaintiff contended  that  his  arrest,  detention  and  dismissal  were
arbitrary, outrageous and high handed.  The defendant denied the same.   The
arrest of the plaintiff was occasioned because there was suspicion  that  he
was involved in the loss of a lot of money.  After the arrest the  plaintiff
was taken to  his  home  where  a  search  was  conducted.   Thereafter  the
plaintiff was handed over to Kawempe Police Station.  The  plaintiff  stated
in his own words that he was not beaten although he was  humiliated  because
the search was carried out in the presence of his neighbours who  had  known
him as a hones person.  There was therefore no evidence  to  show  that  the
plaintiff was treated in oppressive, arbitrary or  unconstitutional  manner.
The arrest, search and detention were done in an effort  to  recover  public
money which had in fact got lost.  The  conduct  of  the  defendant's  agent
does   not   therefore   qualify   the   plaintiff   for   the   claim    of
exemplary/punitive damages:  See Katende   Vs  Attorney  General  [1971]  EA
260.

Issue No. 4:-
What remedies are available to the plaintiff?

It is my finding  that  the  plaintiff's  termination  was  unjustified  and
contrary to employment regulations.  Having found  that  the  plaintiff  was
not guilty of any wrongdoing in the loss of the dollars  it  was  unfair  to
terminate him without proper terminal benefits considering the fact that  he
had invested well about 20 years in the defendant's service.   As  I  stated
earlier, the plaintiff's termination was harsh oppressive and  very  unkind.
When someone takes an employment, he expects something to take home  at  the
end of it  all.   The  circumstances  and  the  nature  of  the  plaintiff's
termination go to the root of injustice.  In the  wisdom  of  the  Inspector
General of Government, the plaintiff should have been  entitled  to  payment
of salary for one year, and  allowances  basing  on  clause  8.05  and  8.06
(exhibit P6).

I  think  that  would  be  an  appropriate  redress  which  would  be  under
redundancy  arrangement  in  the  circumstances  i.e.   989,465   x   12   =
11,873,580/=.  The amount the plaintiff has received shall be deducted  from
the above sum i.e. 11,873,580/= less the amount he received.

The plaintiff is entitled to costs of this suit plus interest on  the  above
at court rate from the date of termination until payment in full.
