(Arising from HCT-00-CC-CS-0763-1994)

Habre International Trading Company Ltd                    Applicant

Versus

Kampala City Council
 Respondent

Legislation referred to:
Civil Procedure Rules


BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The head suit from which this application arises was heard and determined
on 12th November 2002. It was dismissed on the ground that the pleadings
for the plaintiff were signed by an advocate who had no practising
certificate at the time the plaint was filed. The applicant did not appeal.
Two years later he filed this application seeking to review the decision
dismissing the suit. This application was initially heard by my brother,
Okumu Wengi, J., but it was subsequently passed on to me, as the judge that
had heard and decided the decision sought to be reviewed. This is my ruling
in the matter.
As far as I can gather from the application it is contended for the
applicant that 'it has been discovered after a search that the firm of M/S
Kasirye & Company Advocates was indeed a partnership with Peter Paul
Kusiima as the second partner and the counsel who drafted and filed the
plaint in H.C.C.S. No.763 of 1994 who at the time had a valid practising
certificate contrary to the findings of the court.' This would appear to be
essentially the thrust of the ground put forth in support of this
application.
Hussein Abdalla, the managing director of the applicant, swore one of the
affidavits in support of this application. He makes, inter alia, the
following averments,
           '4. That the applicant has after a diligent search discovered
           that indeed the objection was baseless and unfounded as firm of
           M/s Kasirye & Co. Advocates was at the time a partnership with
           Dominic Kasirye and Peter Paul Kusiima as its partners and the
           plaint in H.C.C.S.No. 763 of 1994 was signed and filed by Peter
           Paul Kusiima who was then in possession of a practicing
           certificate.
                 5. That I am advised by the applicant's counsel whose
           advise I verily believe to be true that the discovery of the
           fact that counsel who drafted and filed the plaint in the said
           suit on behalf of the applicant indeed had a valid practising
           certificate which fact could not be discovered at the time of
           the dismissal of the suit that the applicant can apply for
           review of the court's decision.'
Mr. Paul Kusiima swore two affidavits in support of the application and in
rebuttal to the affidavit of Mr. John Nyombi against the application. Mr.
Kusiima states that he signed and filed the plaint in issue. He further
states that Mr. Dominic Kasirye could not have signed the plaint as he was
dead at the time the plaint was signed and filed.
In opposition to the application two affidavits, sworn by Mr. Nelson
Nerima, and Mr. John Nyombi were filed. Mr. Nelson Nerima contends that the
applicant is guilty of laches in bringing this application. Mr. Nyombi
attached to his affidavit a report of a handwriting expert on the signature
of Mr. Dominic Kasirye on the partnership deed, compared with one on the
particulars registered with the Registrar of Business names.
The law under which this application is brought is stated to be Order 42
Rules 1, 2, and 8 of the Civil Procedure Rules, now referred to as Order
XLVI (46) with rules still bearing the same numbers. I shall set it out.
           '1(1) Any person considering himself or herself aggrieved-
                   (a) by a decree from which an appeal is allowed, but from
                 which no appeal has been preferred; or
                                       (b) by a decree or order from which
                 no appeal is hereby allowed,
           and from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence
           which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his
           or her knowledge or could not be produced by him or her at the
           time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of
           some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for
           any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the
           decree passed or order made against him or her, may apply for a
           review of judgement to the court which passed the decree or made
           the order.'
In order for an application for review to succeed on the ground of
discovery of new and important matter or evidence, it is imperative for the
applicant to show that such new matter or evidence, was not only not within
his or her or its knowledge, but that it was not discoverable at the time,
by the exercise of due diligence. It is not enough to repeat these
expressions. The factual basis for such claim must be laid before the
court.
The ground advanced by the applicants is that they have discovered that the
judgment made in this suit was based on a fact that is not true. And that
is that the pleadings were signed, not by Mr. Dominic Kasirye but Mr. Paul
Kusiima, and Mr. Kusiima had a practising certificate. This was a matter
that was peculiarly in the knowledge of the applicant company and its
managing director. When it was raised, the applicant's lawyers could have
ascertained this information from the applicant straight away. They could
have sought an adjournment, to investigate the matter, as it may have taken
them by surprise. Or they could have applied to call evidence on this
matter before the court made a decision. They did neither.
In this application, I am unable to see an explanation, or strict proof, of
the claim that this so called new evidence, was not in possession of, or
could not have been discovered with due diligence, by the applicant. All
the applicant required to do when the objection was raised at the
conclusion of the trial, was to request for time, and call Mr. Kusiima, who
had presented the plaint to court, and he would have explained this matter,
especially given the fact that Mr. Dominic Kasirye, died before this suit
was filed.
I am satisfied that there is no sufficient ground for review of the
judgment of this court that has been put forth by the applicant. I dismiss
this application with costs.
Signed, dated and delivered at Kampala this 23rd day of August 2006


FMS Egonda-Ntende
Judge
