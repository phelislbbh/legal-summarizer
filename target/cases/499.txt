                       BEFORE JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA


JUDGMENT:

The plaintiff William Gibion  Wanendeya  filed  this  suit  against  Monitor
Publications Ltd, a News Media Publications Company.  The plaintiff's  claim
is that in 2000 he agreed with the defendant to print for  him  3000  copies
of a book entitled "The Uganda National Gems"   at  Shs  4,000/=  per  book.
That in breach of the agreement the defendant printed and delivered  to  the
plaintiff only 1,000 copies.  The  failure  to  print  and  deliver  up  the
remaining 2000 copies caused the plaintiff to loose anticipated income  from
the sales thereof of Shs9,000,000/= The  plaintiff  claimed  shs9,000,000/=,
interest at 30% from January 2002 until  payment  in  full  and  costs.  The
plaintiff was unrepresented.

The defendant which was represented by Ms Kemigisha Asumpta, in its written
statement of defence admitted having done some printing work for the
plaintiff which is alleged was on credit terms.  That whatever work was
printed for the plaintiff was dully delivered to and acknowledged receipt
by the plaintiff.

The following issues were agreed upon:-
    1.    Whether the plaintiff placed an order with the defendant   for
printing of
        and delivery of 3,000 books.
Whether the defendant has breached the agreement to print and  deliver  3000
books to the plaintiff.
If so, whether the plaintiff has incurred loss in the sum of shs
9,000,000/= as a result of the breach.
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the remedies sought.

Issue No. 1 whether the plaintiff placed an order with the defendant for
printing of and delivery of 3,000 books

At the Scheduling Conference and in its written statement of defence the
defendant admit it as a fact that the plaintiff did place an order with it
for printing of books but disputes the number of books.  In his testimony
Mr. Wanendeya stated that he had given  the  defendant an order to print
3000 copies of his book for which work he had made an advance payment of
shs 1,800,000/= He said that the book was entitled "The Uganda National
Gems"
The witness tendered in evidence a copy of the book received as Exhibit P5.


While being cross examined the plaintiff stated that the agreement with the
defendant to print the books was verbal.  That he had pressed the order
with the defendant's employees, namely Apolo, who was in charge of
printing, and Aggie Kwesiga Owomugisha also of the printing department.  He
was issued with an Order form and a receipt upon payment of the sum of shs
1,800,000/= He however, claimed that the order form and receipt had been
stolen together with his other documents.  That he had reported the theft
of his documents.

DW1 James Serugo testified that he was the Business Director in the
defendant company at the material time.  As such he was conversant with the
normal process of pressing orders with the defendant.  He stated that the
normal practice was that all Commercial Job would be costed by the Cost
Accountant who would issue a customer with a Profoma Invoice.  If
acceptable to the customer then a formal Invoice would be raised whereby
the customer would be required to pay a 50% deposit of the cost.  The
balance being payable on delivery.  The witness stated that the plaintiff's
order did not follow the normal procedure.  The plaintiff wanted to be
exempted from the deposit requirement.  The plaintiff was therefore
referred to the Managing Director Wafula Ogutu for approval.  The approval
was granted and the Managing Director through the witness's office
instructed the printing to go ahead.  That the job was for printing
plaintiff's books.  According to the witness the defendant printed about
1000 copies being half of the order.  Though the witness could not remember
the original order it was his testimony that they printed half the order
and that the 1000 copies printed were that half of the order

The Evident Act provides:

    "Section 101 (I) Whoever desire any court to give judgment  as  to  any
    legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts  which  he
    or she asserts must prove that  those facts exist.
(2) When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it s said
that the burden of proof lies on that person.

Section 102
The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would
fail if not evidence at all was given on either side.

Section 103
The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that person who
wishes the court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any
law that the proof of that fact shall lie on any particular person."

In the instant case it is the plaintiff who wanted  this  court  to  believe
and give judgment in his favour  that  he  had  placed  an  order  with  the
defendant for printing of and delivery of 3000 copies of his  book  entitled
"The Uganda National Gems" And it is he who would fail if  no  evidence  was
produced by either party with regard to the order.   In  civil  cases,  like
the instant case, the plaintiff has a burden to prove his case on a  balance
of probabilities.  See Sebuliba Vs Cooperative  Bank  Ltd  (1982)  HCB  129.
The standard of proof is on a reasonable degree of probability  but  not  as
high as in criminal cases.  See Miller Vs Ministry of Pensions (1972) 2  All
ER 372.

To discharge this burden in cases of contract the plaintiff must show that
a contract existed between the parties by showing that there was an offer
by one party, an acceptance of such offer by the other party and an
existence of consideration for the performance of the contract.  Court has
to consider the documents tendered, and the parties conduct in determining
whether there was a valid enforceable contract.  See J. K. Patel Vs Spear
Motors Ltd SCCA No 49 of 1991 (1993) VI KALR 85.

In the  instant case the plaintiff want court to find that he plaintiff had
made an order with the defendant  to print 3000 copies of his book, which
order the defendant had accepted to execute at a consideration  of 4000/=
per copy and Shs 1,800,000/= as advance payment was made by the plaintiff.


Counsel for the defendant submitted that the plaintiff had failed to prove
that he had placed an order for 3000 books.  Neither party produced any
documentary evidence, like order form, profoma invoices or any other
document in relation to this order.  The plaintiff's testimony is that the
order was orally made with Apollo and Aggie Kwesiga Owomugisha both
employees of the defendant in the printing department.  Both Apolo and
Owomugisha did not testify so as to rebut the plaintiff's testimony.
Instead James Serugo the defendant's business director gave testimony
whereby he admits the plaintiff's order. However he could not say how big
the order was. His only statement is that they produced 1000 copies being
half of the order this leading to a mere inference that the order could
have been for 2000 copies.  This contradicts the defendant's contention
that the order was for only 59 books.  The plaintiff testified that upon
placing the order he was issued with an Order Form and a receipt for the
deposit but that the same had since been stolen together with his other
documents.  This bit of evidence is corroborated by the defendant's witness
James Serugo whose testimony is that a profoma invoice was raised as the
usual practice, accepted by the plaintiff and an invoice raised but that it
required the approval of the Managing Director since it was on credit
terms.  It is the evidence of this witness that the approval was granted
and printing progressed.  The witness also could not produce the
defendant's copies of the order. When pressed by the plaintiff to produce
the same his explanation was that the defendant's documents had been
destroyed following the defendants decision to close down the printing
department.

The plaintiff's burden of proof is on the balance of probabilities. His
evidence is that he orally placed an order for the printing and delivery of
3000 copies of his book with the defendant's employee namely Apolo and
Owomugisha.

The two employees who were under the control of the defendant and in the
charge of the printing department were not called to contradict the
plaintiff's testimony.  Instead the defendant sought to rely on the
evidence of its business director, whose testimony was to the effect that
this order, like any other orders must have been documented by a Profoma
Invoice copies of which the defendant had destroyed.  I must comment that I
was not satisfied with this witness's explanation as to why the document
had been destroyed.  The defendant also failed to adduce that relevant
documentary evidence so as to contradict the plaintiff's testimony.  The
witness himself was not sure how big the order was.  However, what clearly
comes out from his testimony is that he 1,000 books delivered were just
part of the order.  In view of my observation above I see no reason to
doubt the plaintiff's evidence that he had placed an order for 3000 books.
Therefore, the first issue is resolved in the affirmative.

Issue No. 2 whether the defendant breached the agreement to print and
deliver 3000 books to the plaintiff.

A breach of the contract occurs when one of or both parties fails to
fulfill their obligations imposed by the terms of the contract.  See Nakawa
Trading Co Ltd Vs Coffee Marketing Board H.C.C.S. No. 137 of 1991 (1994) II
KALR 15.  The plaintiff testified that he had made an order for 3000 copies
which the defendant had proceeded to print after the plaintiff had paid a
deposit of shs,1,800,000/=.   That out of the 3000 books the defendant had
delivered only 1000 copies and in breach of the agreement failed to deliver
the remaining 2000 copies.  That despite several demands for the remaining
copies the defendant failed to deliver up.  In paragraph 4 (a) and (b) of
the plaint it is stated:

    "     (a) In the year 2000, the defendant agreed with the plaintiff  to
          print 3000 (three thousand only) copies of  "the  Uganda  National
          Gems" Book at the cost of Shs 4,000/=  (four  thousand  only)  per
          book.
Shs 600 per book was agreed paid in an  advance  and  shs  1,800,000/=  (one
million and eight thousand only)  was  paid  in  cash  on  account  for  the
printing."

While being cross-examined the plaintiff testified that he had made an
advance payment of Shs600/= per copy to be printed.  Thus paying an advance
total sum of shs1, 800,000/= for the order of 3000 books.  That the total
cost per book was shs4000/=.  That for each book he paid Shs. 600/= leaving
a balance Shs3400/= per book to be paid on delivery.  The plaintiff
tendered in evidence the following documents:-

Delivery Note No. 4271 dated 16/10/2001 for 59 Uganda National Gems books -
Exhibit P2
General Receipt 48847 dated 16/10/01 for payment of Shs200, 000/= indicated
printing debt.  Exh. P1
Advice Note and Gate Pass No 12502 dated 16/10/01 for 59 Uganda National
Gems book.  - Exh P3.

The plaintiff explained that by receipt of the 59 copies upon the above
documents he had already paid an advance of shs600/= per book as a
component of the total advance payment of Shs1, 800,000/=.  That on taking
delivery of the 59 books he paid shs 200,000/= as the balance on the 59
books.  That is balance of shs 3400/= per book.  My calculation shows that
the balance on 59 book at 3400/= per book would have been a total of
Shs200, 600.  The witness also tendered in evidence a letter dated 26th
April 2004 where he demands delivery of the remaining books.  In that
letter, exhibit P4, the plaintiff in part states:-
      "Please refer to the above Book which you printed 3000 copies  for  me
      in year 2000 after paying initially agreed costs of shs 600 per  book.
      The balance approximately Shs3, 400/= per book was payable on delivery
      as per attached shs 200,000/=  Receipt  paid  for  59  books  paid  on
      October 16, 2001 and Delivery Note."

The plaintiff denied that he had made an order for only 59 books which  were
delivered and paid for.  He insisted that the 59 books  were  just  delivery
of part of the order for 3000 books.

DW1 James Serugo, the defendant's Business Director, stated that there was
a special arrangement in respect of the plaintiff's order approved by the
defendant's Managing Director whereby payment was to be made after the work
had been done.  That is on delivery of the books.  The witness identified
exhibit P1 as a receipt issued by the defendant acknowledging payment of
Shs200, 000/= The witness stated that he was not aware of any other
payments made by the plaintiff.  He stated that they expected the plaintiff
to pay after delivery of the 1000 copies and that the plaintiff was
notified and that the balance of the books printed would be delivered on
payment.  According to this witness the payment of Shs200, 000/= was not
for the 59 books delivered on that day but for the deposit on printing
works. The witness denied that 3000 copies had been printed.  He stated
that they had only printed 1000 copies which had been delivered to the
plaintiff in bits.  DW3 Tonny Kabatende the defendants Stores Officer at
the material time, testified that he received 1,000 copies of the
plaintiff's book from the Printery Department of the defendant.  The
witness as part of his duties, was supposed to release or deliver the books
to the plaintiff upon production of evidence of payment.  He testified that
the plaintiff picked the books in bits and would on all occasions, be
released to him upon presentation of a receipt as evidence of payment.
That a part from the 1000 which were put in his custody and which were all
picked by the plaintiff there were no other copies brought into the store.
That the last consignment of books collected by the plaintiff was of 59
books collected in 2001 upon the Delivery Note dated 16th October, 2001 -
Exb P2.  The witness explained that by the date of the last delivery he had
released to the plaintiff a total of 941 books all upon evidence of payment
being supplied to him.  The earlier deliveries of 941 plus this last
delivery of 59 book total up to 1000 released by this witness from the
defendant's store to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's evidence and that of DW1 and DW3 show that 1000 copies of
the plaintiff book were printed and delivered to the plaintiff.  'It is
also clear that payment was to be made upon delivery of printed books.
Further the 1000 copies were not collected by the plaintiff in one
consignment but in bits.  The sum of Shs.200, 000/= was part payment of the
printing charges for the 1000 books.  DW3's testimony agrees with that of
the plaintiff's that Shs 200,000 /= was payment upon delivery of the 59
copies.  According to DW3 he had earlier released to the plaintiff 941
copies upon evidence of full payment for them.   This tallies well with the
plaintiff's testimony that Shs200, 000/= was paid as payment of the balance
on 59 copies at Shs4, 000/= per copy following a deposit payment of
Shs600/= per copy.  The defendant has not adduced any evidence to
contradict the plaintiff's evidence   as to what was the agreed charge per
book.  The defendant has not adduced any evidence to show that there was
any unpaid balance due on the 1000 copies printed and delivered to the
plaintiff.  In fact according to DW3 the 1000 books were fully paid for.
His evidence is that the 1000 books were collected in bits and he would
release each bit so collected by the plaintiff upon the witness being
provided with evidence of payment. It was only 1000 copies delivered by the
defendant's printing department to the defendant's store managed by DW3.
There were no other books printed or availed to the defendant's store for
delivery to the plaintiff.  This is what gave rise to the plaintiff's
demand for delivery of the remaining copies and pay for them as evidenced
by the letter exhibit P4.  On the above evidence I find that the plaintiff
has on a balance of probabilities proved that the defendant delivered only
1000 copies and thereby breached the agreement to print and deliver 3000
books to the plaintiff.

Issue No. 3 whether the plaintiff has incurred loss in the sum of shs9,
000,000/= as a result of the breach.

The plaintiff claimed the above sum as the value of the remaining 2000
books.  This is a claim for special damages which had to be specifically
pleaded and strictly proved.  See Kyambadde Vs Mpigi District
Administration (1993) HCB 44.  The plaintiff testified that he expected to
sell each book copy at shs5000/= less 500/= as commission for the selling
book shop which would leave him with an income of Shs4500/= per book.  Thus
the claim for the Shs.9, 000,000/= for the 2000 undelivered books.  In this
regard the plaintiff tendered in evidence a Uganda Bookshop Local Purchase
Order Form No. 4124, as exhibit P6.  It shows that Uganda Bookshop had on
21st October  2003 ordered from the plaintiff 100 copies of Uganda National
 Gems at shs 5000/= per copy.  Charles Lubega Matovu, a storekeeper with
the Uganda Bookshop, testified that in 2001 the Bookshop ordered for and
was supplied 10 copies of the book, and 20 copies in 2002.  That in 2003
they had ordered for 1000 copies upon the LPO exhibit P6 but that the books
were not supplied.  The witness identified exhibit P5 as the book.  The
above evidence shows that:-
      (i) At 5000/= per book for 2000 book expected income was
Shs10,000,000/=
      (ii)  Commission retainable by the selling Bookshop
             at 500/= per copy
Shs 1,000,000/=
     (iii)  Unpaid printing cost per book of shs3, 400/=
Shs 6,800,000/=

This would have left the plaintiff with a gross income of shs2, 200,000/=
This sum includes the sum of Shs1, 200,000/= paid within the sum of shs1,
800,000/= as deposit of the printing cost at shs600/= for the unprinted
2000 books.  Therefore the plaintiff would have had a net profit of shs1,
000,000/=.  He is however, entitled to the refund of the deposit sum of
shs1, 200,000/= on the undelivered 2000 copies.  Taking all the above
evidence in consideration,  I find that the plaintiff has proved that due
to the defendant's failure to print and deliver the 2000 copies he lost an
expected income of Shs2,200,000/=  which sum is awarded to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff is also awarded interest on the above sum at the rate of 30%
per annum from the date of filing this suit until payment in full.  He is
also awarded costs of this suit.

I so order.
