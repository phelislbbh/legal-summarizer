Editors Summary  On 17 September 1997 the Appellants agent sold the suit property by public auction in exercise of the  Appellants statutory power of sale. The Respondent was the highest bidder at KShs 3 200 000 and the  property was knocked down to them on condition that the Respondent would immediately pay 25% of the  sale price and the balance to the Appellant within 30 days from the date of sale. The Respondent paid the  25% deposit and agreed to pay the balance of KShs 2 400 000 within 30 days.  Six days later the Respondent wrote to the Appellant informing the Appellant inter alia that they  needed 60 days to arrange to pay the balance. The Appellant rejected this suggestion by the Respondent.  There was a subsequent meeting between the Appellant and the Respondent. After the meeting, the  Respondent wrote to the Appellant stating that the Respondent would pay the balance within 30 days of  receiving from the Appellants documents of title, discharge of charge and a duly executed transfer and  that the period of 30 days would be extended by consent and on good grounds. The Appellants reacted to  the said letter by refunding to the Respondents the 25% deposit.  Consequently, the Respondents filed suit in the High Court for breach of contract and other liquidated  sum. The Appellant filed a defence, the main basis of which was that the Respondent had made a counter  offer which was unacceptable to the Appellant hence the earlier offer to the Respondent had lapsed.  On 4 June, 1999 the Respondent applied for summary judgment under Order 35 Rules 1(1), 2 and 3 of  the Civil Procedure Rules and for the defence to be struck out under Order 6 Rule 13(1)(c) of the said  Rules for the reason that it might prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action. The High Court  gave summary judgment and struck out the defence, giving rise to this appeal.  Page 76 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  Held  The correspondence between the Appellant and the Respondent after the public auction of the  suit property seemed to vary the conditions of the original offer. There was an issue as to whether that  amounted to a counter-offer the non-acceptance of which terminated the original offer.  Unless the matter is plain and obvious, a party to a civil litigation is not to be deprived of his right to  have his case tried by a proper trial. Wenlock v Moloney and others [1965] 1WLR 1238 followed.  Summary procedure is applied to enable a Plaintiff to obtain quick judgment where there is plainly no  defence. Where the defence is a point of law and the court can see at once that the point is misconceived  or, if arguable, plainly unsustainable, summary judgment will be given. Summary procedure should not  be used for obtaining an immediate trial; the question must be short and dependent on few documents;  Home and Overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (in liquidation) [1990] 1 WLR  153 and Balli Trading v Afalona Shipping The Coral [1993] 1 Lloyds Rep 1 followed. A defendant who  can show by affidavit that there is a bona fide triable issue is to be allowed to defend that issue without  condition; Jacobs v Booth Distillery Co (1901) LT 262 followed. The appeal was allowed.

The purpose of the proceedings in an application for summary  judgment is to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there is plainly no defence to the  claim. And where the defendants only suggested defence is a point of law and the court can see at once  that the point is misconceived or, if arguable, can be shown shortly to be plainly unsustainable, the  plaintiff will be entitled to judgment. The summary nature of the proceedings should not, however, be  allowed to become a means for obtaining, in effect, an immediate trial of the action, for it is only if an  arguable question of law or construction is short and depends on few documents that the procedure is  suitable  see the cases of Home and overseas Insurance Co Ltd v Mentor Insurance Co (UK) Ltd (in  Liquidation) [1990] 1 WLR 153, 158 and Balli Trading  Page 77 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  v Afalona Shipping The Coral [1993] 1 Lloyds Rep 1 CA. A defendant who can show by affidavit that  there is a bona fide triable issue is to be allowed to defend that issue without condition  see the case of  Jacobs v Booths Distillery Co (1901) LT 262 HL.  The genesis of the subject matter of the Appellants appeal to this Court was a letter dated 23  September 1997 addressed to the Appellant by the Respondent seeking title documents, discharge of  charge, a duly executed transfer and rates and rents clearance certificates from the Appellant in respect of  all that parcel of land known as title number Mombasa/Block X/291 situate along Tom Mboya Avenue,  Mombasa together with all the buildings and other improvements being or erected thereon, hereinafter  called the suit property. That letter, where pertinent, also stipulated as follows:  We shall hold the said documents upon our undertaking to release the balance of the purchase price (less  rates and/or rent currently outstanding, if any) within 7 days of registering the transfer aforesaid, or within 60  days from the date of receipt thereof, or in the alternative failing which the same will be returnable upon  demand in their condition of receipt.  Our clients require the 60 days to enable them organise the finance necessary but it is expected this will be  done much earlier.  The Appellant as a chargee to the suit property had on 9 September 1997 in exercise of its statutory  power of sale advertised for sale by public auction the aforesaid property. That sale was to be conducted  on 17 September 1997 at 11:00am by the Appellants agents, Messrs Nadhia Limited auctioneers at their  premises situate along Meru Road, Mombasa. The conditions of sale were as follows:  1. All intending purchasers are requested to verify the details for themselves as these are not warranted  by the auctioneer nor the chargee.  2. T he highest bidder shall be declared the purchaser and pay immediately a deposit of 25 per cent of the  sale price in cash or by bankers cheque. The balance is to be paid within thirty (30) days from the date  of the sale to the chargee.  3. S ale is subject to reserve price and other requisite consent.  As advertised, the auction sale of the suit property was conducted by the Appellants agents, Messrs  Nadhia Limited, auctioneers at their above-mentioned premises in Mombasa on 17 September 1997. At  that sale, the Respondent was the highest bidder at KShs 3 200 000 and at the fall of the hammer was  declared the purchaser. In accordance with the conditions of the auction sale of the suit property, the  Respondent made a down payment of 25% of the purchase price, that is to say, KShs 800 000 and was  subsequently issued with a certificate of sale. The balance of the purchase price amounting to KShs 2 400  000 was to be paid by the Respondent to the Appellant within thirty (30) days from the date of the  auction sale  17 September 1997. Six (6) days later, the Respondent wrote the letter referred to above to  the Appellant. In its letter dated 24 September 1997, Appellants response to the Respondents letter  aforementioned was, where relevant, as follows:  The above mentioned property was sold by public auction. It is a condition that the purchaser should verify  particulars pertaining to rates and ground rent as these are not warranted by the chargee.  In view of this we cannot release the documents as we are expecting to receive the balance of the purchase  price within 30 days.  Page 78 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  Subsequent to this letter, the Appellant and the Respondent met and from their meeting, it would seem  from the letter dated 26 September 1997 that the Respondent accepted to pay to the Appellant the balance  of the purchase price of the suit property within thirty (30) days of receipt of the title documents, the  discharge of charge and a duly executed transfer. According to this latter letter, the thirty (30) days  period above mentioned could have been extended by mutual agreement and for sufficient reasons. The  Appellants reaction to the aforesaid letter was to refund to the Respondent the KShs 800 000 paid by the  Respondent at the auction sale of the suit property the same being the 25% of the purchase price of the  said property. While acknowledging the refund of this sum of money, the Respondent threatened to bring  an action against the Appellant for breach of contract which threat was carried out by the filing of civil  case number 294 of 1998 in the superior court on 10 February 1998. On 12 March 1998 the Appellant  entered appearance and filed a defence to the Respondents suit the gravamen of which was the  Respondents counter-offer varying the conditions of the auction sale of the property which was  unacceptable to the Appellant.  By a notice of motion dated 4 June 1999 and filed in the superior court on the same day the  Respondent applied for summary judgment against the Appellant under Order XXXV Rule 1(1), (2) and  (3) of the Civil Procedure Rules Chapter 21 Laws of Kenya in the sum of KShs 11 800 000 prayed in its  plaint as special damages for loss of bargain being the difference of the resale price of KShs 15 000 000  offered to the Respondent and the auction sale price of KShs 3 200 000. The Respondent also sought to  have the Appellants defence struck out under Order V1 Rule 13(1)(c) of the aforesaid Rules for the  reason that it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the Respondents action against the  Appellant. This application was supported by the Respondents affidavit annexed to which were, the  germane correspondence referred to above which were also annexed to the Appellants replying affidavit.  At the hearing of the Respondents application in the superior court, it was submitted on its behalf  that it was purchasing the suit property for resale and had indeed secured buyers for the same amongst  them being Githere Investments Limited, which had offered to purchase the suit property at  KShs 15 000 000. It was also submitted that the Respondent was not in breach of the thirty (30) days  period within which it was required to pay the balance of the auction purchase price of the suit property  since when the Appellant refunded to the Respondent the KShs 800 000 deposit of the purchase price of  the suit property, the thirty (30) days period had not expired. To this end, the Appellant was in breach of  the contract of sale of the suit property by public auction with the Respondent so that its defence to the  Respondents suit was a sham.  The submission of the Appellant in the superior court was that instead of paying the balance of the  purchase price within the stipulated thirty (30) days in the conditions of sale of the suit property by  public auction, the Respondent counter-offered and sought a sixty (60) day period within which to pay  the balance of the purchase price of the said property. This counter-offer was unacceptable to the  Appellant. It was not therefore in breach of the contract as alleged by the Respondent and its defence to  the Respondents suit disclosed a triable issue entitling it to have unconditional leave to defend the said  suit.  Page 79 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  In its ruling dated and delivered at Nairobi on 5 August 1999 the superior court found the Appellant to  have been in breach of the contract of sale of the suit property by public auction and proceeded to hold  that the Appellants defence to the Respondents suit disclosed no triable issue. In the result, summary  judgment in the sum of KShs 11 800 000 being special damages for loss of bargain was entered in favour  of the Respondent and the Appellants defence was struck out for the reason that it may prejudice,  embarrass or delay the remainder of the Respondents suit against the Appellant. Aggrieved by this  decision, the Appellant now appeals to this Court and has put forward seven grounds of appeal the centre  point of which is that having not been in breach of the contract of sale of the suit property by public  auction it was on that account entitled to unconditional leave to defend the Respondents action against it  in connection therewith. All other issues in the Appellants appeal are dependent on this one primary  issue.  At the hearing of this appeal on 30 November 2000, the force of the submission of counsel for the  Appellant, Mr Ougo, was that the Respondents letter dated 23 September 1997 and addressed to the  Appellant, the pertinent parts of which are set out in this judgment, amounted to a counter-offer which  was not acceptable to the Appellant with the result that the original offer of sale of the suit property by  public auction to the Respondent was terminated. According to Mr Ougo, these were matters that were  pleaded in the Appellants defence in respect of which the Appellant should have been allowed to urge in  the superior court. The position taken by counsel for the Respondent, Mr Kamaara, was however, that  both parties had a firm contract and the Appellant had acted in breach of it as was evident in the refund to  the Respondent by the Appellant of the KShs 800 000 being the 25% per cent of the purchase price of the  suit property even before the expiry of the thirty (30) days period within which the balance of, the  purchase price of the said property was to be paid. According to Mr Kamaara therefore, the superior  court could not be faulted in holding that the Appellants defence raised no triable issue and was a sham.  In whichever way one looks at the correspondence cited in this judgment and addressed to the  Appellant by the Respondent in relation to the contract of sale of the suit property by public auction  whose purport was to vary the conditions of the original offer of sale of the said property to the  Respondent, the same could have been construed as a counter-offer the non-acceptance of which by the  Appellant terminated the original offer and thus vitiating the contract of sale of the suit property by  public auction between the Appellant and the Respondent.  As pointed out at the beginning of this judgment, unless the matter is plain and obvious, a party to a  civil litigation is not to be deprived of his right to have his case determined by a proper trial where, if  necessary, there has been discovery and oral evidence subject to cross-examination for the scope of the  proceedings in an application for summary judgment is to enable a Plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment  where there is plainly no defence to the claim. This cannot be said to have been so in the circumstances  obtaining in the present appeal. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the order of the superior  court entering summary judgment for the Respondent in the sum of KShs 11 800 000 and striking out the  Appellants defence together with the award of costs of the suit with interest thereon at court rates and  order that the Appellant be and is hereby granted unconditional leave to defend the suit in the  Page 80 of [2000] 1 EA 75 (CAK)  superior court and will have the costs of this appeal and those incurred in the superior court in the  defence of the Respondents application for summary judgment and for striking out its defence.
