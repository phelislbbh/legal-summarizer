                    BEFORE: HON. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA

                                  JUDGMENT:

      The Plaintiff, Peter Kaggwa, an advertising and promotion  coordinator
with the Uganda Telecom Limited, filed this  suit  against  the  Defendants,
jointly and severally, seeking general damages, exemplary damages and  costs
for libel contained in an  article  published  by  the  first  defendant  in
Volume 17 No. 76 of the New  Vision  Newspaper  dated  Saturday  30th  March
2002. The first defendant is statutory corporation carrying on  business  of
a daily newspaper publication called "New Vision".  The second defendant  is
the Chief Editor or Editor  in  Chief  of  the  New  Vision  and  the  Chief
Executive  Officer  of  the  1st  Defendant.   The  third  Defendant  was  a
columnist for the New Vision.  The article complained of run as follows:-

         "UTL'S PETER KAGWA PAYS SHS 2M FOR A FROLIC
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  Hot whispers from the scandal
corridors of our dusty town have it that we have a new bad boy in the
house.  Peter Kaggwa a.k.a PK of UTL, was apparently caught pants down with
a Tender Ronnie (an under age girl) by the TR (Tender Ronnie's) mother.
The good woman threw a fit and called the police.  It was not so quietly
settled out of court for a paltry Shs2m. Who knew virgins came so cheap."

      At the scheduling  conference  it  was  agreed  as  a  fact  that  the
publication complained  of  was  made,  that  it  was  false  and  that  the
Plaintiff was entitled to damages.   Only  one  issue  was  framed  for  the
Court's decision being quantum of damages.  In his pleadings  the  plaintiff
prayed for general damages, exemplary damages, interest  on  the  above  and
cost of the suit.

      In paragraph 6 of their written statement of defence the defendants
pleaded as follows:-

         "Following the plaintiffs threat to sue,  the  defendant's  offered
         to compensate him.  In the course of  subsequent  negotiations  and
         meetings of the parties,  the  plaintiff  insisted  on  payment  of
         Ugshs4,000,000/= ---- in consideration for his forbearance to  sue,
         which counter - offer was accepted by the defendants  in  a  letter
         dated 22/4/2002 attached hereto as annex "A"


      Referenced letter exhibit D3 stated:-

         "Please refer to  your  various  correspondences  and  our  meeting
         regarding this matter.  Your proposal of four million shillings  as
         damages in full and final settlement of this matter  is  acceptable
         to us"

The only defence witness Mr. Robert Kabushenga testified  that  he  had,  on
behalf of the defendant's,  held  the  negotiations  towards  a  settlement,
first with Mr. Mathias Sekatawa and later Mr. Daudi Mpanga advocates in  M/S
Mugerwa Masembe & Co Advocates Counsel for the Plaintiff with whom the  said
compensation was agreed upon.  That the defendants' acceptance  was  further
confirmed by the defendants' letter to the Plaintiff  exhibit  D3  but  that
the plaintiff and his Counsel in their letter of 29th  April  2002,  exhibit
D1 reneged on the agreement and opted to  file  this  suit.  That  in  their
letter dated 29th April 2002,  exhibit  D2,  the  defendants  protested  the
Plaintiff's rescission of the agreement.  Mr. Denis Owori, Counsel  for  the
defendant, submitted that the negotiations between the  plaintiff's  counsel
and the defendants which resulted into  the  offer  for  settlement  by  the
Plaintiff, which offer was accepted  by  the  defendants,  resulted  into  a
valid and binding settlement under the contractual doctrine  of  Accord  and
Satisfaction.  He contended that the Plaintiff was  estopped  from  bringing
this suit. He relied  on  the  case  of  British  Russian  Gazette  ltd  V/S
Associated Newspapers Ltd (1933) 2 K. B. 616 where  accord  was  defined  in
the following holding:-

         "--- the purchase of a release from an obligation, whether  arising
         under contract or tort by means of any valuable consideration,  not
         being the actual  performance of the obligation itself, the  Accord
         is the  agreement  by  which  the  obligation  is  discharged.  The
         satisfaction  is  the  consideration  which  makes  the   agreement
         operative"

Counsel argued that the offer verbally discussed with Mr. Daudi Mpanga,  the
Plaintiff's Counsel and  therefore  agent  with  authority  to  act  on  the
plaintiffs behalf, which offer was in writing  accepted  by  the  defendants
vide exhibit D3 amounted to a valid agreement binding on the  plaintiff  and
the defendants and was thus a valid  "accord."   That  the  sum  of  UgShs4,
000,000/= verbally  communicated  by  the  Plaintiff's  Counsel,  which  the
defendants agreed to pay was the "satisfaction."

Regarding the negotiation the Plaintiff's counsel submitted that they were
without prejudice negotiations and thus inadmissible in evidence.  He
referred to the Defendant's letter to the Plaintiff's counsel dated 22nd
April 2003, Exhibit D3 which he termed the originator of the whole matter
and contended that it was marked "without prejudice"

It is the uncontradicted evidence of the defence witness Robert Kabushenga
that he on the Defendant's behalf held meetings with the Plaintiff's
Counsel in one of which held with Mr. Daudi Mpanga compensation to the
Plaintiff was proposed at Shs4,000,000/=.  The law is that so long as
Counsel is acting for the party in a case and his instructions have not
been terminated, he has full control over the conduct of the case and has
apparent authority to compromise all matters connected with the matter See
B.N. Technical Services Ltd V/S Francis X Rugunda H.C. Misc. Appl. No. 75
of 1998, Bulandina Nankya & Anor V/S Bulasio Konde (1979) HCB 239, Roberts
Nakaana & Anor  V/S Joyce Nayiga H.C. Misc. Appl. 829 of 2001.  The
Plaintiffs Case before this court was handled by M/s Mugerwa & Masembe
Advocates and all correspondence exhibited were either to or from the said
firm of advocates.  Therefore they had instructions at all material times
to conduct this matter with apparent authority to bind the Plaintiff.

However, the defendant's evidence shows that the proposal made on behalf of
the Plaintiff in the meeting the defence witness held with Mr. Daudi Mpanga
was still subject to the defendant's written acceptance.  The defendant's
acceptance was communicated in the letter dated 22nd April 2002, Exhibit
D3.  This letter was headed "WITHOUT PREJUDICE."

The general rule is that letters written during a dispute between parties
which are written for the purposes of settling a dispute and which are
expressed to have been made "without prejudice" cannot generally be
admitted in evidence.  See Halsbury's Laws of England 4 Ed Vol. 17 page 151
para 121, Smith Shropshire District Council V/S Amos (1987) 1 ALLER 340.
Section 22 of he Evidence Act deals with admissions made on condition that
evidence of thereof shall not be given. The section states:-

         "In civil cases, no admission is relevant  if  it  is  made  either
         upon an express condition that evidence of it is not  to  be  given
         or circumstances from which the court can infer  that  the  parties
         agreed together that evidence of it should not be given."

By heading the acceptance letter "without prejudice,"  the  defendants  made
clear to the plaintiff that the acceptance had been  made  upon  an  express
condition that evidence of that acceptance was not to be given in the  event
of  any  future  proceedings.   Therefore  neither  the  Plaintiff  nor  the
Defendants can rely on  that  letter  to  prove  that  compensation  to  the
Plaintiff in the sum  of  Shs4,  000,000/=  had  been  agreed  upon  by  the
parties.

The defence witness's evidence shows that following the defendant's letter,
exhibit D3, the Plaintiff in his Counsel's letter exhibit D1 reneged on the
agreement but that in the defendant's reply, exhibit D2, the defendants
protested the plaintiff's recession of the agreement.  This time the
defendant's letter was not written "without prejudice."  Such a situation
was dealt with in Sakar on Evidence 11th Edition at page 215 where the
learned authors states:-

         "Where a letter was sent by  an  attorney  to  the  opposite  party
         containing  an  offer  to  "purchase  peace"  and  headed  "without
         prejudice", it cannot be given in evidence, nor  the  reply  though
         not  guarded  in  a  similar  manner.   A  letter  marked  "without
         prejudice" protects subsequent and previous  letters  in  the  same
         correspondence".


  Therefore the communication in the defendants letter exhibit  D2  did  not
provide a cure to the defendants' "without prejudice" acceptance in  exhibit
D3, the effect of which acceptance was that if the   plaintiff  was  not  to
stand by his proposal in the negotiations, the  defendants  having  accepted
it was to have no effect at all.

In the circumstances there was no compromise agreement concluded between
the parties.  I therefore find that the contractual doctrine of accord and
satisfaction is not applicable to the circumstances of this case.  The
above settles the issue whether the defendants acceptance to settle the
plaintiffs claim in the sum of Shs4, 000,000/= is binding on the plaintiff.

That now brings me to the sole issue framed by the parties - the quantum of
damages.  The plaintiff in this case seeks both general damages and
exemplary, damages.  On the law on assessment of damages in defamation the
Plaintiffs Counsel referred me to the English case of John V/S MGN Limited
(1996) 2 All ER 35 where at page 4 the court stated this on compensatory
damages:-

         "The successful plaintiff in a defamation  action  is  entitled  to
         receive  as  general  compensatory  damages,  such  sum   as   will
         compensate him for the  wrong  he  has  suffered.   That  sum  must
         compensate him for he damage to his reputation; vindicate his  good
         name, and take account of the distress, hurt and humiliation  which
         the  defamatory  publication  has   caused.    In   assessing   the
         appropriate damages for injury to  reputation  the  most  important
         factor is the gravity of the libel the more closely it touches  the
         plaintiff's personal integrity,  professional  reputation,  honour,
         courage, loyalty and the core attributes of  his  personality,  the
         more serious it is likely to be. The extent of publication is  also
         very  relevant,  a  libel  published  to  millions  has  a  greater
         potential to cause damage than a libel published to  a  handful  of
         people.  A successful plaintiff may properly look to  an  award  of
         damages to vindicate his reputation but the  significance  of  this
         is much greater in a case where the defendant asserts the truth  of
         the libel and refuses any retraction or  apology  than  in  a  case
         where the defendant acknowledges the falsity of what was  published
         and publicly expresses regret that the libelous took place. ---"

On exemplary damages it was stated in the same case at page 55 as follows:-

         "A summary of the existing English  law  on  exemplary  damages  in
         actions for defamation, accepted by the Court of Appeal  in  Riches
         V/S News Group Newspaper Ltd (1985) 2 All ER 845  at  850,  ---  as
         concise, correct and comprehensive, appears in Duncan and Neill  on
         Defamation (2nd edn, 1983)  para  18.27.   The  passage  remains  a
         correct summary of the relevant law.  So far as  relevant  to  this
         case, -----, the passage reads:-

            Exemplary damages can only be awarded if  the  plaintiff  proves
            that the defendant when he made the publication knew that he was
            committing a  tort  or  was  reckless  whether  his  action  was
            tortious or not, and decided to publish because the prospects of
            material advantage outweighed the prospects  of  material  loss.
            What is necessary is that the tortious act  must  be  done  with
            guilty knowledge for the motive that  the  chances  of  economic
            advantage outweigh the chances of economic or  perhaps  physical
            penalty.
The mere fact that a libel is committed in the course of a business carried
on for profit, for example the business of a newspaper publisher, is not by
itself sufficient to justify an award of exemplary damages.


         If the case is one where  exemplary  damages  can  be  awarded  the
         court or jury should consider whether the sum which it proposes  to
         award by way of compensatory damages is  sufficient  not  only  for
         the purposes  of  compensating  the  plaintiff  but  also  for  the
         purpose of  punishing  the  defendant.   It  is  only  if  the  sum
         proposed by way of  compensatory  damages  (which  may  include  an
         element of aggravated damages) is insufficient that  the  court  or
         jury should add to it enough to bring it up to a sum sufficient  as
         punishment".


The sum awarded as damages should be a single sum which will include, where
appropriate, any elements of aggravated or exemplary damages---

A jury should be warned of a danger of an excessive award

           (f) The means of the parties, though irrelevant to the issue  of
           compensatory damages, can be  taken  into  account  in  awarding
           exemplary damages."


The plaintiff's Counsel also referred to the  Kenyan  case  of  Machira  V/S
Mwangi (2001) EA 110 wherein Mulwa J. stated at page 113:-

         "A person  who  considers  himself  defamed  can  bring  an  action
         against the  person  who  authorized  the  defamatory  material  or
         caused it to be published.  He can claim damages for injury to  his
         reputation  and  for  the  hurt  to  his   feelings.    These   are
         compensatory damages and are termed damages  at  large.   "See  the
         English case Cassel and Co. Ltd V/S Broone  and  Another  (1972)  1
         All ER  801  where  the  Judge  observes:  'The  whole  process  of
         assessing damages where  they  are  'at  large'  is  essentially  a
         matter of impression and not addition.'


The awarding of damages to the plaintiff is for the purposes of vindicating
him to the public for the wrong done to him."

The learned judge went on to quote part of the portion already herein  above
quoted from the case of John V/S MGN Ltd (supra)


In his submission Counsel for the Defendants referred to the case of  Roakes
V/S Barnard (1964) AC 1129 wherein the House of Lords held that:-

         "apart from any statutory provision, exemplary damages may only  be
         awarded where there is oppressive,  arbitrary  or  unconstitutional
         action by servants  of  the  Government  or  where  the  defendants
         conduct  was  calculated  to  procure   him   some   benefit,   not
         necessarily financial at the expense of the plaintiff."


The above case was in the Kenya case of Obonyo  and  Another  V/S  Municipal
Council of  Kisumu (1971) EA 91 accepted  by  Spry  V.P  as  authoritatively
setting out the law as to exemplary damages in tort.  And  at  page  96  the
learned Judge stated:-

         "---- It is well established that when damages are at large  and  a
         court is making a general award, it may take into  account  factors
         such as malice or arrogance on the part of the defendant, and  this
         is regarded  as  humiliation  or  distress.   Damages  enhanced  on
         account  of  such  aggravation  are   regarded   as   still   being
         essentially compensatory in nature.  On the other  hand,  exemplary
         damages are  completely  outside  the  field  of  compensation  and
         although the benefit of them goes to the person  who  was  wronged,
         their object is entirely punitive"

In  his  submissions  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff  argued  that,   in   the
circumstances of this case, the Plaintiff is entitled to  both  compensatory
and exemplary damages.  He suggested that, considering the  gravity  of  the
defamation, the extent of the publication  and  the  comparative  awards  in
similar cases, the Plaintiff was entitled to an award of  Ugshs45,  000,000.
Further that the article was maliciously published for  gain  and  contended
that exemplary damages are thus justified in the sum of Ugshs50  million  to
punish the defendants.

On the other hand Counsel for the defendants contended that the Plaintiff
is only entitled to nominal damages if any at all.  He relied on the
authority of Samwiri Lugogobe V/S Hussein Lukaga (1980) HCB 18 where in
Allen J. held that in a defamation case, when considering the quotation of
damages, what matters is the injury done to the plaintiff's reputation and
character taking into account his wounded feelings and any insulting or
malicious conduct on the part of the defendant.  In absence of evidence of
any of those factors an award of nominal damages only would be made for
injury done to the plaintiff's good name.

The offending article stated that the Plaintiff "was apparently caught
pants down with a Tender Ronnie (an under age girl) -" In his evidence the
plaintiff stated that having sexual intercourse with an underage girl is
immoral and criminal.  The Concise Oxford Dictionary (7th Ed.) defines
"underage" to mean "not old enough, esp. not yet of adult status." Under
Section 129(I) of the Penal Code Act it is a criminal offence to have
unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of eighteen years,
the maximum sentence for which is death.  The implication of the article is
that the Plaintiff was caught by the victim's mother in the act of
committing a serious criminal offence of defilement.

The article further stated "--- the good woman threw a fit and called the
police.  It was not so quietly settled out of Court for a petty the 2m ---"
The implication is that the Plaintiff corruptingly avoided prosecution by
bribing the police and paying for the silence of the complainant.  The
alleged plaintiffs corrupt conduct in the article also amounts to an
offence under Sections 2(b) and 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act
punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or fine not
exceeding three hundred currency points or both.   Such criminal
implications show the gravity of the defamatory article.

With regard to the extent of the publication Counsel for the Plaintiff
submitted that the article was published in a leading national newspaper
with wide circulation and particularly in a popular column entitled "Have
you heard".  Exhibit P3 shows that before the introduction of the "Have you
hear" Column for the July- December 1998 period the average daily sales of
the New Vision was 31,704 copies and after the introduction of the column
the average daily sale of the paper was 33,472 for the period January -
June 1999.  The above evidence shows that there was increase in the sales
following the introduction of the "Have You Heard" column.  The Plaintiff
did not produce any evidence to show the circulation of the New Vision
paper, particularly there is no evidence to show the circulation of the
paper on 30th March so as to show the article's effect to the publication.
 However, it was pleaded in paragraph 2 of the plaint that the New Vision
is a national daily newspaper distributed widely throughout Uganda and
posted on the internet.  Paragraph 2 above was admitted by the defendants
in paragraph 2 of their written statement of defence.  It is trite that
each party is bound by his or her pleadings.  I therefore agreed with the
Plaintiff's Counsel that the fact of wide circulation is conceded by the
defendants.

In David Etuket & Anor V/S The New Vision Printing and Publishing
Corporation H.C.C. S.  No. 86 of 1996 (unreported) it was held:

         "In order to prove the  reduction  of  reputation  or  esteem,  the
         plaintiff must adduce evidence from either his  or  her  colleagues
         or from any member of the society who  knew  the  plaintiff  before
         the publication of the statement complained of  and  who  read  the
         article.  The court can then judge as to  how  the  right  thinking
         members  of  society   regarded   the   plaintiff   following   the
         publication of the article.  The plaintiff's evidence alone  cannot
         prove that  important  element  of  defamation  which  is  also  so
         crucial in the determination of quantum of the general damages"


Sir John Spray while dealing  with  the  law  governing  the  assessment  of
damages for defamation in his book Civil Law of Defamation  in  East  Africa
stated at paragraph 118 pages 45-46 thus:-

         "The status of the person  to  whom  the  defamatory  statement  is
         published may also be relevant.  Thus  publication  to  a  person's
         employer, especially of an allegation of dishonesty is regarded  as
         particularly  serious,  since  it  might  lead  to   dismissal   or
         prosecution.  The fact that the person to  whom  the  statement  is
         published is in position to dismiss it  out  of  hand  or  even  to
         check its accuracy is not  ground  for  awarding  nominal  damages,
         indeed if a libel is sufficiently outrageous, it  may  be  that  no
         one in the world will  believe  it,  but  that  is  no  reason  for
         depriving the victim of the appropriate damages."


In the defamatory  article  the  plaintiff  is  described  as  "UTL's  Peter
Kaggwa." It is a fact that  the  Plaintiff  was  at  all  material  time  an
employee of Uganda Telecom  Ltd  (UTL)  as  an  Advertising  and  Promotions
Coordinator. The Plaintiff testified that as part of his duties he  was  the
Coordinator of his employers' sponsorship of the Kampala Kids Link a  league
which comprised of underage  children.   That  the  article  was  not  taken
lightly by his superiors at work.  For example the plaintiff testified  that
he  was  directed  by  the  Human  Resource  Manager  to   communicate   his
explanation on the article to his  co-staff  numbering  about  six  hundred.
PW1, the Plaintiff's co-staff stated that he had received an email  in  that
regard.  However, no such email was exhibited in  Court.   It  is  also  the
plaintiff's testimony that the Human Resource Manager appreciated the  state
the  Plaintiff  was  in  following  the  publication.   The  Plaintiff  also
testified that the Company Secretary  and  the  Commercial  Director  Mobile
Division  of  UTL  contacted  him  about  the  article.   That  the  Company
Secretary advised him to file all  his  correspondences  about  the  article
with the Resource Department.  I am however, of the view  that  this  advice
must have been intended to safeguard the Plaintiff against any  eventuality.
 In cross-examination the Plaintiff admitted that he was  not  subjected  to
any disciplinary proceedings by his employer, that he was still holding  the
same job, so his employment status was not effected,.  In fact he was  voted
one of the best employees of his department  in  December  2002,  the  exact
year of the publication.

      Francis David Obela (PW1) testified that he had no reasons to doubt
anything published in the New Vision.  That he believed the article and has
since tried to distance himself from the Plaintiff.  However, the witness
contradicted his belief in the New Vision when he stated in cross-
examination that he did not believe in the apology carried in the same
paper.  One wonders whether the witness was not in his evidence in chief
only exaggerating his reaction to the article.


      The plaintiff testified that his mother, Esther Byarugaba (PW2), was
devasted    by the article and blamed him for the immoral act portrayed by
the article.  PW2 stated that when she read the article she was annoyed and
cried due to the damage by the Plaintiff's conduct to her entire family.
That she believed the story as it was carried by her favourite newspaper.
However, when she was cross-examined about the effect of the apology on
her, her reaction was that she had already believed the Plaintiff's
explanation that he had not done what had been reported.  The plaintiff's
mother believed in the Plaintiff's innocence even before the apology, she
believed the plaintiff's explanation.

      The Plaintiff further testified that he received several calls from
friends and relatives about the article. That he also received emails,
though none was exhibited in court.  However it is his testimony that
despite the publication he could still be called upon to chair wedding
meetings which shows that his friends still regarded him highly.

      The Plaintiff was at the time of the publication about 28 years old.
He was and is still single.  He complained that his chances of wedding were
affected by the article.  But the Plaintiff did not produce any evidence to
show that he had had any girl friend or fianc who had deserted him as a
result of the article.  He admitted that he was neither prosecuted nor
investigated as a result of the publication.

      With regard to the claim for exemplary damages, the Plaintiff's
Counsel invited Court to consider the evidence of the defence's sole
witness Robert Kabushega where he testified that the defendants after the
publication carried out investigations and found that the story was untrue.
 Counsel argued that as the leading National Newspaper the defendants
should have carried out their investigation before and not after the
publication of the article.  I was referred to John V/S MGN Ltd (Supra),
wherein their Lordships at page 36 stated thus:-


         "On the facts the defendants' total  failure  to  check  the  story
         clearly contributed reckless with the result  that  the  Judge  was
         right to refer to the issue of exemplary damages to the jury"

Counsel submitted that the  Defendants  failure  to  investigate  the  story
before its publication justified an award of exemplary damages.  In my  view
it is only prudent that Newspapers  should  establish  the  truthfulness  or
justification of any story before its publication.

On the issue as to whether there was a calculation by the Defendant's that
the prospects of material advantage outweighed the prospects of material
loss the plaintiff's Counsel submitted that this can be evidenced by the
prominence with which the article was placed in the newspaper.  He
contended that the article was extremely prominent being at the very top of
the "Have You Heard" column and further that the Defendant is in the
business of publication of news for gain. Exhibit P1, the pull out of the
paper from the Newspaper in which the article was published, shows that it
was at page 13.  It was thus not one of the lead stories of the day.  As I
have already indicated herein, there was a general increase in sales
following the introduction of the "Have You Heard" column but the Plaintiff
did to produce any evidence to show the probable effect of the article to
the sales of the day as compared to the usual sales.

It was among the agreed facts that the article was false and undisputed
that having so established, the defendants published an apology in the
"Have you Heard" column of the 6th of April 2002.  The defamatory article
was published on 30th March 2002 and the apology run in the next issue of
the same "Have you Heard" column of 6th April 2002. I find this to have
been the first most appropriate opportunity.  The apology must have been
intended to put right the impression the defamatory article had made on the
people who had read the article.  An apology should not have the effect of
opening old wounds nor should it have the effect of aggravating the damage
and it should avoid the readers of the apology who had not read the
defamatory article becoming fully aware of the contents of the article
being apologized for.  An apology for the defamatory statement by the
defendant may mitigate damages while its absence may aggravate them.  The
apologetic conduct of the defendants is further exhibited by the fact that
they willingly held discussions and communications with the Plaintiff's
Counsel aimed towards an amicable settlement of the Plaintiff's claim.

      The Plaintiff's Counsel has drawn      my attention to the award in
the Kenyan cases of Marcharia V/S Mwangi (supra) where the Plaintiff, an
Advocate, was awarded KShs8,000,000/= (equivalent to Ugshs.184 million) as
compensatory damages for having been depicted as dishonest and Biwot V/S
Clays (2000) 2 EA 334 where  a total of KShs30million (equivalent  to
Ugshs300,000million) was awarded for both compensatory and aggravated
damages to  a politician for depicting him a murderer and as corrupt.

      On the local scene I have come across Sarah Kanabo V/S Ngabo
Newspaper (1994) VI KALR 169 where the Plaintiff a businesswoman was
depicted a murder and the defendant sought to justify the allegations but
failed and the plaintiff was awarded Shs2,250,000/= as general damages.  In
Jeffrey Thompson & Anor V/S Teddy Cheeye & Anor (1995) IV KALR 158 where
the first Plaintiff the Managing Director of the second Plaintiff Company
was alleged by the defendants to have bribed the World Bank Officials and
producing false invoices from competitors to gain business.  The defendants
failed to prove the truth of the allegations.  The first Plaintiff was
awarded Shs6 million general damages and Shs.2 million punitive damages.
In Richard Kaijuka V/S Teddy Seezi Cheeye & Others (1995) 11 KALR 110 the
Plaintiff was depicted a criminal, unfit to be a minister, corrupt and
abusing his office.  He was awarded Ushs15million as general and aggravated
damages.  The above Ugandan judgments are of 1994/1995.  The financial
conditions have since changed greatly.

Having viewed the principles of law governing the quantum of damages in
defamation cases, taking into account the facts before this court and
guided by earlier court awards in more or less similar circumstances I am
inclined to award the Plaintiff Ugshs17million (seventeen million
shillings) compensatory general damages with interest at the Court rate
from the date of this judgment until payment in full.  I decline to make an
award for aggravated damages.  The Plaintiff is awarded costs of this suit
to be taxed.  I so order.
