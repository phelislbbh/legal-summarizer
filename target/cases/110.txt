Dave v Business Machines Ltd  [1974] 1 EA 68 (CAN)  Division: Court of Appeal at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 14 March 1974  Case Number: 45/1973 (24/74)  Before: Sir William Duffus P, Law Ag V-P and Musoke JA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  [1] Practice and Procedure  Attendance  Defendant not attending  Plaintiff must prove case.  Editors Summary  The appellant did not attend the hearing of the case brought against him by the appellant. The judge gave  judgment relying on letters which were handed to him but not proved.  On appeal  Held  where a defence has been filed but the defendant does not attend, the plaintiff must prove his case  by evidence.  Appeal allowed.  Case referred to Judgment:  (1) Eksteen v. Kutosi (1951), 24 (2) K.L.R. 90.  Judgment  The following considered judgments were read. Law Ag V-P: The respondent company sold some  shares to the appellant, and sued him for Shs. 60,000/- being the balance allegedly due under the contract  of sale. The appellant entered an appearance and by his defence denied the debt, and pleaded that the  contract was conditional on certain obligations to be fulfilled by the respondent company which had not  been fulfilled. On 26 July 1972, the suit was by consent fixed for hearing on 25 and 26 July 1973. On 25  July 1973, when the hearing was due to begin, Mr. Hira appeared for the appellant. He made it clear that  his instructions were limited to applying for an adjournment, as the appellant had been deported to the  United Kingdom and his evidence might have to be taken on commission. The judge was not impressed  by this belated application in a suit which had been set down for hearing a year earlier, and rejected it out  of hand, in my respectful opinion quite rightly. Mr. Hira then withdrew. The hearing then began, with  only counsel for the respondent company present, and one would have expected him to prove his case ex  parte, in accordance with O. 9B, r. 3 (a) of the Civil Procedure (Revised) Rules, as read with s. 25 of the  Civil Procedure Act, which requires a court to hear a case before pronouncing judgment, even when the  claim is for a liquidated amount, when the defendant has duly entered an appearance and filed a defence  as happened here. Unfortunately this was not done. What did happen, according to the record, is that  counsel for the respondent company addressed the court as follows:  Claim for liquidated sum of Shs. 60,000/- balance of purchase price of shares transferred by the plaintiff at  agreed price of Shs. 20/- per share. Full amount Shs. 100,000/-. Shs. 40,000/- paid. Balance Shs. 60,000/-.  Agreed bundle of correspondence. Exhibit one. Pray for judgment as prayed. Defendant has not appeared.  This last statement was not correct, unless counsel meant, as I think he must  Page 69 of [1974] 1 EA 68 (CAN)  have done, that the defendant had not attended the hearing (within the meaning of O. 9B, r. 3) either in  person or through an advocate. The judge accepted the invitation to give judgment, and did so in the  following terms:  This being a claim for a liquidated sum representing the balance of agreed purchase price of shares  transferred by the plaintiff to the defendant, I enter judgment as prayed for the plaintiff.  I agree with Mr. Khanna for the appellant, and with his first four grounds of appeal, that the judge had no  power to proceed as he did, and to dispense with proof of the claim before entering judgment. He appears  to have done so purely because the claim was for a liquidated sum, but the suit was not brought under the  summary procedure laid down by O. 35. Even then there must be affidavit evidence verifying the cause  of action and any amount claimed. When, as in this case, the ordinary procedure applies and the  defendant has entered an appearance but failed to attend at the hearing, I would respectfully adopt what  was said by Windham, J. in Eksteen v. Kutosi (1951), 24 (2) K.L.R. 90, as to the correct procedure to be  followed:  Now if an appearance had been entered and a defence filed, and if the only failure on defendants part had  been a failure to appear, either personally or through his advocate, on the day when the suit was called on for  hearing, then I think the plaintiff ought properly to have been called upon formally to prove his claim, that is  to say, to prove everything the burden of proof of which, on the pleadings, lay on him in order to establish his  claim.  Mr. Couldrey for the respondent company, who did not represent it in the High Court proceedings the  subject of this appeal, supported the judgment on the ground that the agreed bundle of correspondence  was before the judge, and that the contract relied on by the respondent company was to be found from  perusal of that correspondence. I cannot accept that proposition. So far as I am aware, the agreeing of a  bundle of correspondence amounts to no more than an admission by the parties that the letters and  documents therein contained were written or received by them, or on their behalf, respectively. It does  not amount to an admission as to the truth or evidential value of the contents of those letters and  documents.  There was thus in my considered opinion no evidence before the judge to justify the judgment  delivered by him. I would allow this appeal, with costs; I would set aside the judgment and decree  appealed from, and direct that the suit be remitted to the High Court to be set down for hearing and  determination before another judge. I would order that the costs of the suit, including costs already  incurred, be in the discretion of the judge who hears and determines it.  Sir William Duffus P: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of the Acting Vice-President.  In this case the appellant had entered an appearance and filed his defence but then failed to appear on the  day fixed for hearing.  The judge should have proceeded under O. 9, r. 3 of the Civil Procedure (Revised) Rules 1948 and  proceeded to hear the case ex parte. Mr. Couldrey for the respondent concedes this but submits that, in  fact, this is what the trial judge did. The record is not clear but on the face of it does appear that the trial  judge dealt with the matter as a claim for liquidated damages in which no appearance had been entered or  defence filed. I agree, though, that it must be presumed that the judge properly dealt with the matter as an  ex parte trial, and that he relied on the correspondence admitted as exhibit 1 to establish the plaintiffs  case, but it does appear that this correspondence was wrongly admitted.  Page 70 of [1974] 1 EA 68 (CAN)  Letters can be put in by consent of the advocates for the parties, but in this case it was an ex parte trial  and the advocate for the appellant was not present and unable therefore to agree that the letters went in  by consent. It is not sufficient for the advocate who appears for the plaintiff to state from the bar that this  was the agreed correspondence. The danger of this is illustrated here where the advocate for the  appellant, Mr. Khanna also states from the bar that the correspondence was only agreed subject to formal  proof at the hearing.  No evidence was called to prove the plaintiffs case and the trial judge should have called for such  evidence and not proceeded to judgment as he did.  I agree with the Acting Vice-President that this appeal must be allowed and new trial ordered. I fully  agree with the order set out in his judgment and as Musoke, J.A. also agrees, it is so ordered.  Musoke J: I agree.  Appeal allowed.
