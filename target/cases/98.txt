               BEFORE:      THE HON. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA

JUDGMENT

The plaintiff's case is briefly that the defendant was an  employee  of  the
plaintiff.  In the course of the employment the defendant  was  granted  two
staff credit facilities.  A car loan of  shs  10,000,000/=  and  a  personal
loan of shs, 11,055,000/=.  The defendant's employment was  terminated  when
there was an outstanding amount shs, 5,440,133/= on the car loan and  before
paying up the personal loan.  The plaintiff's claim is for 16,495,134/=  due
on the two loans and interest at 20% per annum from the day payment was  due
until full and final payment.   The  defendant  was  served  by  substituted
service by advertisement in the New Vision newspaper of 5th  December  2005.
The defendant did not file a written statement of defence and the  suit  was
set down for formal proof.

Mr. David Mpanga appeared for the plaintiff and framed the following
issues:

Whether the defendant owes the plaintiff any money.

If so how much

Remedies

The plaintiff adduced the evidence John Keru Kahumbu who testified that he
is the Financial Controller of CITI BANK (U) LTD, the plaintiff's bank.
That between 2000 and 2001 he was charged with the establishment of the
financial unit of the bank.  In 2001 the witness recruited the defendant
Collin Semakula as an Assistant Financial Controller.  That in the course
of his employment with the plaintiff the defendant was on 21st July 2004
granted a car loan of shs. 10,000,000/=.  The witness tendered in evidence
a receipt form whereby the defendant acknowledges receipt of the above sum
payable by monthly installments shs. 400,000/= with interest at the
prevailing staff rate.  The receipt form was received in evidence as
exhibit P1.

The witness further testified that on 14th July 2004 the defendant was
given a personal loan of shs. 10,500,000/=.  The witness tendered in
evidence the defendant's bank statement in respect of the two loans
received in evidence as exhibit P3.  The statement showed that the balance
outstanding on the car loan on 26th July 2005 was shs. 4,999,996/=.  The
balance outstanding on the personal loan was shs. 9,975,514/= as of 27th
June 2005.  The witness explained that the bank had stopped charging
interest on the above mentioned dates.

The witness further testified that while in the plaintiff's employment the
defendant was in May 2005 in charge of the payment of tax to the Uganda
Revenue Authority.  The plaintiff bank's cheque payable to Uganda Revenue
Authority was intercepted in one of the banks while someone was trying to
cash it.  The defendant was arrested in connection with that cheque.  He
was released on police bond which he jumped and never returned to work.
His services were thereafter terminated by the bank while with the above
outstanding loan repayments.

The plaintiff's evidence shows that the defendant owed the plaintiff a sum
of shs. 4,999,996/= as of 26th July 2005 on the car loan.  Further that the
defendant owed the plaintiff a sum of shs. 9,925,514/= as of the 27th June
2005.  Both were staff loans on which the float interest was 16.2%.  The
above evidence is neither denied nor rebutted by any evidence or pleading
to the contrary by the defendant.  It's trite that failure to file a
defence raises a presumption of constructive admission of the claim made in
the plaint and the evidence of the plaintiff.  In absence of any
contradicting evidence I must accept the plaintiff's witness' evidence as
truthful.  In the premises I find that the defendant by the termination of
his employment with the plaintiff owed the plaintiff money on both the
personal loan and the car loan advanced to him as a staff of the
plaintiff.  The first issue is answered in the affirmative.

The plaintiff had in its pleadings claimed a sum of shs. 16,495,134/=.
However the evidence adduced by the plaintiff has only proved total sum of
shs. 14,975,510/= in respect of both loans.  The plaintiff is therefore
awarded the sum of shs. 14,975,510/=


The plaintiff had also claimed interest of 20% per annum.  However the
evidence adduced show that the interest charged was 16.2% per annum.  The
plaintiff stopped charging interest on 26th July 2005 and filed this suit
on 28th October 2005.  Therefore there was no delay.  The plaintiff is
therefore awarded interest in the above decretal sum at the rate of 16.7%
per annum from 20th July 2005 until payment in full.  The plaintiff is also
awarded costs of this suit.

I so order.
