                            THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA                 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF UGANDA, AT KAMPALA CORAM:       HON. JUSTICE A.E.N. MPAGI-BAHIGEINE, JA.       HON. JUSTICE C.N.B. KITUMBA, JA       HON. JUSTICE S.B.K. KAVUMA. JA                            CIVIL APPEAL NO.32/2002        ATTORNEY GENERAL:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::APPELLANT.                                     VERSUS  OSOTRACO LTD::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::RESPONDENT.    [Appeal from the judgement of the High Court (Egonda-Ntende J] dated 20th             March 2002 in High Court Civil Suit No.1380 of 1986]     JUDGMENT OF A.E.N. MPAGI-BAHIGEINE, JA.   This appeal arises from the judgement and orders of the High Court  (Egonda- Ntende J) dated 20th March 2002. The learned Judge ruled section 15 (1)  (b) of the Government Proceedings Act not to be  in  conformity  with  the  1995 Constitution and made an ancillary order of eviction against  the  appellant and its agents, with costs. The order of eviction was to  be  complied  with within 30 days of the date of the judgement.   The background to this suit was that the respondent, Osotraco  Ltd,  claimed to be the registered proprietor of the suit property, at Plot No.  69  Mbuya Hill, Kampala; having  purchased  the  same  from  Uganda  Times  Newspapers Limited in June 1985 and got duly registered. The property was, however,  at the material time occupied by employees of the Ministry of  Information  who refused to vacate, despite a request to do  so.  The  Ministry  claimed  the property to be theirs whereupon the respondent filed HCCS No. 1380 of  1986, claiming the following reliefs:-        a) An Order of eviction from the suit premises;        b) A permanent injunction;        c) Special and General damages;        d) Mesne profits;        e) Interest and costs of the suit.   The amended memorandum of appeal comprises only two grounds, namely;-         1. That the learned Judge erred in law  and  fact  when  he  construed          section 15 (1) (b) of the Government Proceedings Act not to  be  in          conformity with the Constitution.         2. That the learned Judge erred in law in granting the  respondent  an          order of vacant possession of the suit property and/or eviction  as          against the appellant.      Mr. Mike Chibita,  learned  Principal  State  Attorney,  for  the  appellant argued that the learned trial Judge misconstrued section 15 (1) (b)  of  the Government Proceedings Act and in so doing failed  to  redirect  himself  to article 273 as he could have but encroached on article 137, contrary to  his mandate. Article 137 (3) vests in the Constitutional Court powers to make  a declaration as to any inconsistence or contradiction of any law or act  with a provision of the Constitution. The learned trial Judge usurped the  powers of the Constitutional Court. Learned Principal State Attorney,  pointed  out that section 15 (1) (b) involves a substantial question of law and  in  view of its importance could not be dealt with so casually. The  Judge  ought  to have referred the question to the Constitutional Court for its  decision  on the matter.   Learned  Counsel  further  argued  that  this  matter  involved  an  Act  of Parliament as against the Constitution and that the Judge basically  amended the Act of Parliament and yet he had no such powers to do so. This  amounted to venturing into the territory  of  the  Constitutional  Court.  He  prayed Court to rectify the judgement and quash the orders thereunder.   In reply, Mr.  Christopher  Madrama  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent, maintained that the learned trial Judge was correctly moving  under  article 273 (1) and did not exceed his jurisdiction. The learned  Judge  was  indeed modifying  the  existing  law,  otherwise  article  273  would  be  rendered inoperative. The Judge acted properly, especially in light of  article  126. None of the parties reserved any question for interpretation and  the  Judge on his own motion considered whether there was such question to be  referred to the Constitutional Court and found  that  there  was  none.  Mr.  Madrama prayed court to dismiss the appeal as the learned Judge had the power to  do what he did.   The learned Judge held;-         "In the circumstances of this case a declaratory order  is  less  than       appropriate relief. It is not effective redress. And the provisions of       existing law, that is the proviso (b) to section 15 of the  Government       Proceedings Act, that would compel  this  court  to  avail  only  such       relief, is not in conformity with the constitution. I would  therefore       construe it in such a manner, by qualifying the proviso (b) to section       15 of the Government Proceedings Act, not to be applicable to the case       at hand. I therefore order the defendant  and  its  servants  to  give       vacant possession of the suit property to  the  plaintiff,  not  later       than thirty days from the date of  pronouncement  of  this  judgement,       failing which eviction shall issue.....".   Section 15 (1) (b) of the Government Proceedings Act which  is  now  section 14 (1) (b) of the Government Proceedings Act (Chapter 77) under the Laws  OF Uganda 2000, reads;-         "14. (1) In any Civil proceedings by or against  the  Government,  the       court shall, subject to this Act, have power to make all  such  orders       as it has power to make in proceedings  between  private  persons  and       otherwise to give such appropriate relief as  the  case  may  require;       except that-         a)..........................         b) In any proceedings against the Government for the recovery of  land       or other property, the court shall not make an order for the  recovery       of the land or the delivery of the property, but may in lieu of  those       orders make an order declaring  that  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  as       against the Government to the land or property or to possession of the       land or property".   The learned Judge in construing section 15 (1) (b) not to be  in  conformity with the constitution claimed to be  acting  under  article  273  (1)  which provides;-         "273. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Article, the operation  of       the existing law after the coming into force of the constitution shall       not be affected by the coming into force of this constitution but  the       existing law shall be construed with  such  modifications,  adoptions,       qualifications and exceptions as may be necessary  to  bring  it  into       conformity with this Constitution.         (2) For the purposes of this article, the  expression  "existing  law"       means the written  law  of  Uganda  or  any  part  of  it  as  existed       immediately  before  the  coming  into  force  of  this  constitution,       including any Act of Parliament or  Statute  or  Statutory  instrument       enacted or made before that date which is to come  into  force  on  or       after that date".   This court has in a number of cases  pronounced  itself  on  the  import  of article 273 and ruled that it only empowers all courts  to  modify  existing unjust laws without necessarily having  to  refer  all  such  cases  to  the constitutional court. This provision enables the court to  expedite  justice by construing unjust and archaic laws and bringing them in  conformity  with the Constitution, so that they do not exist and are void.   This article does not oust the  jurisdiction  of  the  Constitutional  Court under article 137 where it can later declare  these  laws  unconstitutional. This Court has applied article 273 in a number of  cases.  In  Pyarali  Abdu Ismail v Adrian Sibo, Constitutional  Petition  No.9  of  1997,  this  court directed the trial Judge to construe and modify section 11 (4)  (b)  of  the Expropriated Properties Act No. 9 of 1982 which was prescribing  unfair  and inadequate compensation for compulsorily acquired property. Section  11  (4) (b) was adapted and qualified so as to conform to article 26 (2) (b) (1)  of the  Constitution  providing  for  prompt  payment  of  fair  and   adequate compensation  for  the  property.  The  matter  had  been  referred  to  the Constitutional Court under article 137 (5). This course of action was  found not to have been necessary. The Judge should have moved under  article  273, without wasting any time, and applied the constitutional provisions.   Further illustrations as to how article 273 is to be applied  can  be  found in the neighboring jurisdiction, in the  case  of  Ephrahim  v  Pastory  and Another  (1970)  LRC  (Const.)  757,  the  Tanzanian  Constitution  of  1984 construed section 4 (1) of the Act No.16 of 1984, which was similar  to  our article 273. A woman in one of the clans in Tanzania had  validly  inherited a piece of land from her father by will. She later sold the land to  a  non- clan member. Their customary law did not allow a female member of  the  clan to sell land to a non-clan member. The position was, however, different  for a male member of the clan. Her nephew sued the buyer  to  recover  the  land claiming that the sale was void  as  under  their  customary  law  a  female member could not sell land belonging to  a  clan.  The  Tanzanian  Court  of Appeal held that customary law as an existing law was construed as  modified to be void for being inconsistent with the provision of the Bill  of  Rights that provides against discrimination on the basis of sex.   In Bull v Minister of Home Affairs (1987) LRC  (Const.)  547,  the  Zimbabwe Constitution which came into force  in  1980  had  a  provision  similar  to article 273. In an action to declare  section  106  (2)  of  their  Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act (Cap 59)  which  restricted  the  right  to  bail contrary to sections 13 and 18 of  their  Constitution,  the  Supreme  Court held that the provision in the  Criminal  Procedure  and  Evidence  Act  was inconsistent with the right to liberty in the  Bill  of  Rights.  The  court agreed that if indeed that provision  in  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  was inconsistent with the right to liberty prescribed  in  the  Bill  of  Rights then it would be as modified such that it did not exist but void.   The learned Judge in his judgement reviewed a number  of  foreign  decisions whose primary object was "to do away with the archaic State  protection  and to place the state or the Government at par with any  other  juristic  legal entity in line with modern social thinking of progressive  societies".  This is the object of article 273 as illustrated by  the  above  authorities.  It cannot therefore, be said that he acted outside the ambit  of  article  273. Mr. Chibita asserted that the learned Judge "strayed" into the  province  of article 137, when he said:-         "The Constitution of Uganda is the Supreme Law, and any  law  that  is       inconsistent with it, is void to the extent of the inconsistency  vide       article 2 of the Constitution. At the same time  Article  273  of  the       Constitution  requires  existing  law  to  be  construed   with   such       modifications, adoptions, qualifications  and  exceptions  as  may  be       necessary to bring it into conformity with the Constitution.....         I am aware that under Article 137  (5)  of  the  Constitution  if  any       question arises as to the interpretation  of  the  Constitution  in  a       court of law, (Which includes this Court), the court may, if it is  of       the opinion that the question involves a substantial question of  law,       refer the  question  to  the  Constitutional  Court  for  decision  in       accordance with clause (1) of Article 137. It  is  the  Constitutional       Court to determine any question with regard to interpretation  of  the       Constitution. But where the question is simply the construing  of  the       existing law with such modification, adaptations,  qualifications  and       exceptions as to bring such law into conformity with the Constitution,       in my view, this may be determined by the court before  which  such  a       question arises.         The question before me implicit in the issue whether the plaintiff  is       entitled to an eviction order or not against the Attorney  General  is       whether the existing law, in terms of the proviso to section 15 of the       Government Proceedings Act, is in conformity with the Constitution  of       Uganda, and is not whether it may be construed in such a manner as  to       bring it in conformity with the Constitution of Uganda".   The foregoing is mere self-direction,  by  the  learned  Judge,  as  to  the import of the exclusive mandate under articles  137  and  273.  The  mandate under each article is different. Article 137 reads;-         "(1).............         (2)..............         (3) A person who alleges that;-      a) An Act of Parliament or any other law or anything in or done under the       authority of any law; or      b) Any act or omission by any person or  authority,  is  unconstitutional       with or in contravention of a  provision  of  this  Constitution,  may       petition the Constitutional Court for a declaration  to  that  effect,       and for redress where appropriate.         (4)..............         (5) Where any question as to the interpretation of  this  constitution       arises in any proceedings in a court of law other than a  field  court       martial, the court;-      a) May, if any party to the proceedings request it to do  so,  refer  the       question to the Constitutional Court for decision in  accordance  with       clause (1) of this article.         (6)...............         (7).................."   The import of article 137 clause (3) which is the  operative  one  has  been highlighted several times in various judgements of both this court  and  the Supreme Court.  In  Attorney  General  v  Major  General  David  Tinyefunza, Constitutional Appeal No.1 of 1987, my Lord Mulenga JSC,  had  this  to  say about clause (3);-               "................Under clause  3  the  Constitutional  Court  is       empowered to do more than ""interpret" in the sense of "giving meaning       to words" of the provisions of the Constitutional. Under paragraph (a)       of clause (3), the constitutional  court  is  empowered  to,  and  may       "interpret" provisions of an Act of Parliament or  any  other  law  in       order to determine whether such Act or other law is inconsistent  with       some provision of the Constitution even if the latter is so clear that       there is no question as to its interpretation.....".   His lordship summed up;-                      ".....It  is  my  considered   opinion   that   the   new       constitution, in clause (3) of Article 137 gives to the Constitutional       Court, over and above the jurisdiction to interpret  the  Constitution       in sense of giving meaning to words and expressions therein,  original       jurisdiction, (a) to review Acts of Parliament, and other laws and (b)       to determine any question on the  inconsistence  of  anything  with  a       provision of the  constitution,  and/or  on  the  contravention  of  a       provision of the Constitution by anything".    Clearly there is nothing in the judgment of  the  learned  trial  Judge  to support Mr. Chibita's contention that he attempted to do any of  the  above, to interpret or give any meaning  to  any  words  or  review  any  law.  His preoccupation was with trying to modify the archaic section 15  (1)  (b)  by bringing it into conformity with the 1995 Constitution, article  26  thereof which protects the citizen's right to own property.   Mr. Chibita in challenging the Judge's orders, relied heavily  on  the  case of the Attorney General v Silver Spring Hotel Ltd and others, Supreme  Court Civil Appeal No.1/1989, where section 15 was highlighted  as  "an  enactment of special application, dealing, inter-alia  with  injunctions  against  the Government and providing safeguards against  judicial  interference  in  the Government's  exercise  of  its  prerogatives  and  privileges   in   public interest. To protect the Government against embarrassing  court  injunctions and to keep the machinery of Government  going.  Their  Lordships  concluded that in view of the importance of section 15, it is expected to  be  amended or repealed by a bold express  provision  but  should  not  be  left  to  an implied repeal. It is a matter that requires careful consideration so as  to replace it with a law that will serve the public interest and  the  ends  of justice.   The Silver Springs case predates the 1995 Constitution by about  six  years. Times have changed. The decision cannot therefore be  said  to  be  in  line with the spirit of the new Constitution especially  article  126  (1)  which provides that;-         "126 (1) Judicial powers is derived  from  the  people  and  shall  be       exercised by the courts established under  this  Constitution  in  the       name of the people and in conformity with law  and  with  the  values,       norms and aspirations of the people".   That being the case I entirely agree with the learned  Judge  that  the  law has to be construed in line  with  the  thinking  or  norms  of  progressive societies.   The trial Judge referred to an Indian case of N.  Nagendra  Rao  and  Co.  v State of A.P. AIR (1994) S.C. 2663 R.OH, where Sahai J. said inter alia;-         "No legal or political system today can place the state above  law  as       it is unjust and unfair for a citizen to be deprived of  his  property       illegally by negligent act of the officers of the  state  without  any       remedy. The modern social approach is to do away  with  archaic  state       protection and place the state or the Government at par with any other       juristic legal entity".   He also referred to Byne v Ireland and the Attorney General  (1972)  1R  241 at 282, where Walsha JSC said;-         "Where the people by the Constitution create rights against the  state       or impose duties upon the state, a remedy  to  enforce  them  must  be       deemed to be also available. It is as much the duty of  the  state  to       render justice against itself in  favour  of  citizens  as  it  is  to       administer the same between private individuals. There is  nothing  in       the Constitution envisaging  the  writing  into  it  of  a  theory  of       immunity from the suit of the state (a state set up by the  people  to       be governed in accordance with the  provisions  of  the  Constitution)       stemming from or based upon the immunity of a personal  sovereign  who       was the key stone of a feudal edifice- English Common  law  practices,       doctrines or immunities cannot qualify or dilute the provisions of the       Constitution".   I respectfully subscribe to the above reasons. It is clear  from  the  above authorities that  since  the  1995  Constitution,  the  rights,  powers  and immunities of the State are not immutable anymore. Article  20  (2)  enjoins everybody including Government agencies to protect  and  respect  individual fundamental human rights. The Constitution has primacy over all  other  laws and the historic common law  doctrines  restricting  the  liability  of  the state  should  not  be  allowed  to  stand  in  the  way  of  constitutional protection of fundamental  rights.  Article  26  protects  the  respondent's right to own property. The respondent having obtained judgement  is  clearly entitled to a meaningful form of redress under article 50, as the  Judge  so put it.   Since this is not a case of compulsory acquisition in the  public  interest, the respondent would be entitled to have his property back.   The learned Judge was moving under article  273  and  did  not  encroach  on article 137 as alleged by the appellant. I would thus  confirm  the  Judge's orders of eviction and costs against the appellant.   In my view, ground 2 becomes superfluous.  I would dismiss the  appeal  with costs. Since my lords,  Kitumba  and  Kavuma  JJA,  also  agree,  it  is  so dismissed. The trial Judge's orders are hereby  confirmed  with  costs  here and below.
