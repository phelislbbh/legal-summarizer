                                   VERSUS

UGANDA NATIONAL CHAMBER OF
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRY              :::::::::::::::::::::     DEFENDANT

BEFORE:  THE HONOURABLE MR JUSTICE YOROKAMU BAMWINE

Cases cited:
Robert Coussens -Vs- Attorney General, SCCA No. 8/1999.

J U D G M E N T:

The plaintiff's case against the defendant is for recovery of salary
arrears.  From the evidence, the plaintiff was an employee of the defendant
for the period 1997 - 2005. He started with Shs.100, 000= which was
eventually increased to Shs.200, 000=.

Four issues were framed for Court's determination:
1.    Whether the plaintiff was paid an increased salary of Shs.500,000=.
2.    Whether the increase was authorized by the Board of directors  of  the
      defendant.
3.    Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs claimed in the
plaint.

Representations:
Mr. Atuhaire for the plaintiff.
Mr. Kavuma for the defendant.
Before I delve  into  assessment  of  evidence  on  record,  I  consider  it
necessary to warn myself on the burden of proof in a case  of  this  nature.
In law a fact is said to be proved when the Court is  satisfied  as  to  its
truth.  The general rule is that the burden of proof lies on the  party  who
asserts the affirmative of the issue or  question  in  dispute.   When  that
party adduces evidence sufficient  to  raise  a  presumption  that  what  he
asserts is true, he is said to shift the  burden  of  proof,  that  is,  his
allegation is presumed to be true, unless his opponent adduces  evidence  to
rebut  the  presumption.   The  standard  of  proof  is  on  a  balance   of
probabilities.  In the instant case, the  plaintiff  has  alleged  that  the
defendant owes him salary arrears.  The defendant denies.  The burden  rests
on the plaintiff to prove his claim.

Issue No. 1:  Whether the plaintiff was paid an increased salary of
Shs.500, 000=.

The plaintiff gave evidence as PW1 and tendered in evidence payment
vouchers prepared on occasions when he was paid a sum of Shs.500, 000= as
salary.  The vouchers are on record collectively as P. Exh. VII.  The
defendant has not given evidence to challenge their authenticity.  I accept
his evidence and find that while in the employment of the defendant, he
earned that salary.

Issue No. 2:  Whether the increase was authorized by the Board of directors
of the defendant.

The plaintiff was an accountant.  He was not a member of the Board of
Directors.  He was employed to work for the Chamber under the direction of
the Secretary General to whom he was fully responsible.

In an internal memo dated 21/10/2000, P. Exh. 11, one John Muhanuka, the
Ag. Secretary General made a submission to the Appointments Committee of
the Board of Directors.  In that submission, the Ag. Secretary proposed to
the Committee that the plaintiff's salary hitherto fixed at Shs.200, 000=
be increased and fixed at Shs.500,000= per month.  On 6th November, 2000,
one A.K. Kiranda, Secretary Admin and Human Resources Dept wrote to the
plaintiff as follows:
         "SUBJECT:  SALARY ADJUSTMENT
At the last meeting of the Appointments and Training Committee of the Board
of Directors of the UNCCI held on Saturday 21st October 2000, the following
were approved in your favour.
         1. After noting your performance and as per recommendation  by  the
           Secretary General, your salary has been  revised  and  fixed  at
           Shs.500, 000= per month with effect from 1st November, 2000.
2.    You shall be Administrative and Property Assistant working under and
reporting to the Secretary for Administration and Human Resource
Department.
3.    Paragraph 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 of your contract signed between you and
the Chamber on 23rd September 1998 are now nullified with immediate effect
and your service in the chamber shall now be on a permanent basis.  Other
terms and conditions of your service indicated in your contract are still
valid.

           Please let me know whether the above changes in your status  are
           acceptable to you.


            Wishing you success,


      For and on behalf of UNCCI.

      A.K. Kiranda
      Secretary Admin. & Human Resource Dept".

The letter was copied to the President, UNCCI,  the  Secretary  General  and
Secretary for Finance.

There is evidence that on 9th November, 2000, the plaintiff wrote to the
Secretary for Admin. & Human Resource Dept accepting the changes in his
status.  The submission to the Appointments Committee of the Board is on
record as P. Exh. 11, Memo to the plaintiff advising him on salary
adjustment as P. Exh. 111 and the plaintiff's acceptance as P. Exh. 1V. The
defendant has not made any indication to Court that the documents are fake.
 The presumption is that they are genuine.  His witness, PW2 John Muhanuka,
worked as Secretary General of the Chamber till his retirement in 2003.  He
confirmed authorship of P. Exh. 2.  His evidence is that the Committee
considered his submission and approved the salary increment to Shs.500,
000=.  I have been invited to find that a corporation such as the defendant
acts through its officers which officers are headed by the Corporation's
executive board.  That it is these officers who, during their term of
office, are vested with full and final authority to take management
decisions and actions.  I agree.  In all these circumstances, I have not
appreciated the basis for the defendant's denial of the plaintiff's monthly
salary being increased to Shs.500, 000=.  There is no merit in the denial.
In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the presumption is that the
officers of the defendant were acting under the direction of the Board when
they increased the salary from Shs.200, 000= to Shs.500, 000=.  They did so
as agents of the defendant.  Our law recognizes that he who does something
through another does it himself.  I would in the circumstances of this
case, answer the second issue in the affirmative and I do so.

Issue No. 3:  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs sought.

There is evidence that the plaintiff partook of the increased salary of
Shs.500, 000= from 1/11/2000 to 31/3/2002.  He started service with the
defendant on a salary of Shs.100, 000=.  An extract from the audited
accounts of 2003 shows that between August 1997 and 30/10/2000, his salary
amounting to Shs.3, 889,000= was withheld by the defendant.
There is evidence also that from 1/4/2002 the defendant paid the plaintiff
Shs.350, 000= monthly instead of the authorized Shs.500, 000=.  The amount
withheld was Shs.150, 000= per month fro nine months.  This adds up to
Shs.1, 350,000= and not Shs.1, 800,000= as claimed by the plaintiff.

From the records also, between 1/1/2003 - 23/2/2005, he was paid a monthly
salary of Shs.400, 000= as against the approved Shs.500, 000=.  For this
period of 26 months, the amount withheld from him was Shs.2, 600,000=.

From the above calculations, the total amount withheld up to the time of
termination was Shs.7, 839,000=.  This amount is decreed to him.

In addition to the above, the plaintiff claims a sum of Shs.200, 000=
allegedly expended on pursuing payment of his arrears.  The rule has long
been established that special damages must be pleaded and proved by the
party claiming them if they are to be awarded.  I think that there was
pleading but not strict proof of this claim.  It is disallowed.

As regards general damages, these are at large.  The quantum is within the
discretion of the Court.  The plaintiff claimed that he has suffered
inconvenience as a result of being deprived money that rightly belonged to
him.  He claims that he suffered great humiliation socially; that his
children lost their education by leaving the schools where he had placed
them; and, that he had a 'dead' year at the University where he was
pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce degree course.  In my view, if at all he
suffered all these ills, it was on account of loss of a job, not on account
of the withheld salary arrears.  Having said so, I'm satisfied that he has
been greatly inconvenienced for no good reason at all.  He has prayed for
general damages in the sum of Shs.50m and in support thereof cited to me
Robert Coussens -Vs- Attorney General, SCCA No. 8/1999.  In that case the
plaintiff/appellant claimed that he had suffered humiliation,
embarrassment, inconvenience and lost opportunities because of the
defendant/respondent's wrongful conduct.  The case is of course of little
relevance to the issue herein in that what is in issue herein is non-
payment of arrears and not the fact of termination per se.

Working on the assumption that the plaintiff is entitled to general damages
and doing the best I can in the circumstances  of this case, I would award
him damages assessed at Shs.2,000,000=.

The award for special damages shall attract interest at 25% per annum from
the date of filing the suit till payment in full and general damages at the
same rate from the date of judgment till payment in full.  The plaintiff
shall also have the costs of the suit.

In the result, judgment is entered for the plaintiff against the defendant
as follows:
(i)   Special damages:  Shs.7, 839,000= (seven million eight hundred  thirty
      nine thousand only).
(ii)  General damages:  Shs.2, 000,000= (Two million only).

(iii) Interest on (i) at the rate of 25% per annum from the date of filing
and on (ii) from the date of judgment till payment in full.
(iv)  Costs of the suit.
