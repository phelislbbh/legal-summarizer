KABUYE VICTORIA (MRS) ......... .......RESPONDENT/PLAINTIFF

                    BEFORE: HON. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA

RULING

This is an application brought by Notice of Motion under Order  9  rule  12,
Order 52 rules 1 and 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules and Section  98  of  the
Civil Procedure Act seeking orders that:-

The exparte judgement as against the 2nd Defendant be set aside.
Leave be granted to the Applicant/2nd Defendant to file a defence.
Costs for this application be provided for.

The grounds of the application are briefly that:-

The Managing Director of the Applicant received summons in H.C.C. S. No.
753 of 2007 on the 21st September, 2007 and the alleged service had been
affected on a receptionist of the Applicant company who only stamped the
summons with the Applicant's Stamp on the 13th September 2007 awaiting
receipt by the Applicant's Managing Director.
Upon receipt of summons from the said employee, a one Agatha Bugenyi, on
the 21st September 2007, the Applicant's Managing Director promptly
instructed the Applicant's lawyers M/S Nangwala, Rexida & Co Advocates to
defend the Applicant.
The Applicant's lawyers immediately filed a Written Statement of defence on
the 4th October 2007 within the fifteen days from 21st September 2007.
The Applicant has a good defence to the suit in the sense that:-

The Applicant does not owe the Respondent any duty or legal or other
relationship and the suit is misconceived and bad in law.
The Applicant only had fiduciary relationship with YWCA as an accountholder
and as a trustee for its funds and operation of the alleged account to
which it lawfully and rightly carried out its duties.

The application is supported by three affidavits.  One sworn by Agatha
Bugenyi, a receptionist of the Applicant company, another by A Reza Kalan
the Applicant's Managing Director and the third by Kemigisha Assumpta an
advocate with M/S Nangwala, Rexida & Co Advocates.  The Respondent filed
two affidavits in reply.  One deponed by Leah Kiseri, the Ag. Executive
Director of the Uganda Young Women's Christian Association (YMCA) and the
second by Gaswaga Julius a Court Process Server.

Representation was Mr. Rexida for the applicant and Mr. Kitumba-Magala for
the Respondent.

In his submission Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the Exparte
Judgement entered against the Applicant was upon an ineffective service of
the summons.  He urged that service on a receptionist   or a secretary in a
company is not effective service.  He contended that effective service was
on 21st September 2007 when the Principal Officer of the Company received
the summons.  That the Written Statement of Defence was filed within 15
days and thus in time.  On the other hand Counsel for the Respondent argued
that there was proper service upon the legal officer of the applicant.  He
referred to the affidavit in reply sworn by Gaswaga Julius.  Alternatively
Counsel argued that the summons were left at the registered office or
business place of the Applicant.

Order 9 rule 12 of the Civil Procedure Rules gives court unlimited or
unrestricted discretion to set aside an exparte judgement.  However, Court
can only set aside an exparte judgment under the rule if the Applicant:-

satisfies Court that there is a reasonable explanation why the exparte
judgement was entered against him.
has produced to Court evidence that he has a prima facie defence to the
claim.

See: Masaka Farmers and Produce Ltd Vs Aloysius Tamale & Anor (1992 - 93)
HCB 203.

The Court record shows that the Deputy Registrar of this Court pursuant to
the Registrar's powers under Order 50 rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules
entered judgment against the Applicant pursuant to Order 9 rule 11(2) to
the Civil Procedure Rules for failure to file a defence.  Judgement was
entered on the basis of an affidavit of service dated 20th September 2007,
wherein the process server, Gaswaga Julius states that on 13th September
2007 he proceeded to effect Court process upon the Applicant Company at
Crane Chambers, Legal Department on 2nd Floor.  The 5th paragraph states:

    "That a Secretary in the legal department of Crane Bank  Ltd.  received
    both the plaint  and  a  copy  of  the  summons  to  file  defence  and
    acknowledged service and a photostat  copy  of  the  same  is  herewith
    attached as proof to that effect."

The exparte judgement was entered on 3rd October 2007.  The Applicant  filed
a Written Statement of Defence on 4th October, 2007.

In Gaswaga Julius' affidavit in reply he states:

    "4. THAT on the 13th September 2007, when I went to serve Court  papers
    in respect of HCCS No. 753/2007, I  introduced  myself  to  M/S  Agatha
    Bugenyi, and told her the purpose of my visit to the Bank.


THAT she referred me to the Legal Officer one Nalwaga Prosy who sits on the
same floor (2nd Floor) whom I informed that I had court papers to serve.

THAT she received the papers from me perused through and afterwards advised
me to take them to Agatha to receive and stamp them.

That I went back to Agatha who received the Court papers and stamped them
after which she handed back to me my copy of service.

THAT if I had not been advised and directed by the Legal Officer Nalwoga
Prosy, I would have not effected the service."

In her affidavit in support of the application Agatha Bugenyi states:-

    "2 THAT on the 13th September 2007, a gentleman approached me while  at
    the Applicant Company's Office with documents which he said  he  wanted
    to give to the Managing Director.


THAT I told him that the Managing Director was not available at that time
and I requested him to leave me with the documents which I would pass on to
the Managing Director.

THAT he gave me papers and I stamped on his copy but did not stamp or sign
the  ones he left with me"

Agatha Bugenyi and A Reza Kalan in their respective  affidavits  state  that
Agatha Bugenyi is a receptionist with the Applicant Company.  The  Applicant
contends that service on her was not effective service.  The  Respondent  on
the other hand contends that there was proper service on the  Legal  Officer
of the Applicant Company, one Nalwanga Prosy.   Alternatively  that  summons
were left at the business premises of the Applicant.

First and foremost to obtain judgment in default the plaintiff must first
satisfy the Registrar that the summons in the suit had been effectively
served on the defendant against whom judgment is being sought.  As regards
service on corporations Order 29 rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules
provides:-


    "Subject to any statutory provision regulating service of process, when
    the suit is against a corporation, the summons may be served.-
on the secretary  or  any  director   or  other  principal  officer  of  the
corporation; or
by leaving it or sending it by post addressed to the corporation at the
registered office, or if there is no registered office, then at the place
where the corporation carries on business."


Under sub-rule 2 (a) above service must be on a secretary, any  director  or
other principal officer of the  corporation.   In  his  affidavit  sworn  in
opposition to this application the Process Server says that he had  effected
service on the Legal Officer of the Applicant  Company  one  Nalwanga  Prosy
who directed him to hand the papers to Agatha Bugenyi.  A legal  officer  in
my view qualified for a principal officer of the  Company,  most  especially
in cases like this one where papers being served were  legal  documents.   I
however find it strange that in the affidavit  of  service  upon  which  the
exparte judgement was based there is no mention of  service  on  either  the
Legal officer or the said Nalwanga Prosy.  The affidavit  of  service  talks
of only a Secretary in the legal department.  It is this  secretary  who  is
stated to have received and  acknowledged  service.   This  must  have  been
Agatha Bugenyi talked about in the Process Servers affidavit in reply.   The
Secretary envisaged in sub-rule 2(a) above must be a principal officer,  not
a Secretary at the level of a receptionist.   In  Kampala  City  Council  Vs
Apollo Hotel Corporation (1985) HCB77 Odoki J. (as he then  was)  held  that
under Order 26 rule 2(a) (now Order 29)  such  process  must  be  served  on
senior officers of the corporation who are responsible  for  the  management
of the corporation and therefore who are in a position  to  take  action  on
behalf of the corporation.  The Blacks  Law  Dictionary  7th  Ed  page  1355
defines "Secretary" to mean:

    "A corporation officer in charge of official correspondence, minutes of
    board meetings, and records of stock ownership and transfer."


And "Corporation officer" as

    "An officer of a corporation, such as a CEO,  president,  secretary  or
    treasurer."


Section 1 (y) of the Companies Act defines "Officer" in relation to  a  body
corporate to include "A director, manager or secretary."


The officer served as per the affidavit of  service  on  which  the  exparte
judgment was based was a mere secretary in the legal department who did  not
qualify for a principle officer of  the  company.   It  was  this  affidavit
intended to satisfy the Registrar  that  there  was  effective  service  and
therefore which should have properly described the Officer served so  as  to
prove that she satisfied the provision of sub-rule  2  (a).   The  affidavit
did  not  satisfactorily  describe  the  secretary  so   served.    In   the
circumstances the statements in the affidavit  in  reply  that  service  was
effected on the Legal Officer of the Applicant, one Nalwanga  Prosy  appears
an afterthought designed to defeat the averments in both Agatha Bugenyi  and
A Raze Kalan's respective affidavits that  summons  were  served  on  Agatha
Bugenyi a receptionist.  In Sherali Bandali  Jaffer  and  others  Vs  Yefusa
Weraga Seggane (1972) 2 ULR 108 summons to be served on a limited  liability
company were left with an office attendant.  It was held that service on  an
office attendant was not effective under Order 26 (now 29)  rule  2(a)  CPR.
In the circumstances of this  case  I  find  that  there  was  no  effective
service on a principal officer of the Applicant company.

It now remains to consider whether it was service under rule 2(b) of the
said order.  Under this arm of the rule summons may be served by leaving it
at or by sending it by post to the registered office of the corporation or
if there is no registered office, then at the place where the corporation
carries on business.  The summons were clearly on 13th September 2007 left
with Agatha Bugenyi at her place of work with the applicant.  Therefore it
is not disputed that the summons were left at the Applicant's place of
business.  I have looked at the summons issued in the instant suit.  They
were addressed to the applicant and two others. Sub-rule 2(b) requires the
summons so addressed to the defendant to be left at the Registered Office
of the defendant.  I have studied the affidavits of service by Gaswaga
Julius and his affidavit in reply.  None of the two affidavits state that
the place where the summons were left with Agatha Bugenyi was the
applicant's registered office.  The registered office of the corporation
envisaged under the rule must be such office as is registered pursuit to
the provisions of sections 107 and 108 of the Companies Act.  Though the
place where the summons were left could pass for a place where the
Applicant company carries on business; to satisfy the requirements of the
sub-rule, if there is no registered office, then that fact ought to have
been deponed to.  It is only then that service in the alternative by
leaving it at the place where the applicant carries on business would have
been effective and good.  It is trite that he who alleges has a duty to
satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that which he asserts.  If
the applicant has a registered office then service elsewhere not being its
registered office would be bad and not effective.  In absence of any
averment as to information relating to the Applicant registered office I
find that the respondent has failed to discharge that burden.  In the
premises the Respondent failed to show that there was effective service of
the summons on the applicant in the manner provided by Order 29 of the
Civil Procedure Rules.  See Harriet Nankabirwa Vs Uganda Ecumerical Church
Loan Fund Ltd HCT-00-CC-MA-No 241 of 2004. Both Agatha Bugenyi and A Reza
Kalan in their respective affidavits in support state that Agatha Bugenyi
gave the summons to Reza Kalan on 21st September 2007.  Reza Kalan is
described as the Managing Director of the Applicant Company thus within the
officers envisaged by Order 29 rule 2 (a) CPR.  Service of summons is
intended to bring to the notice of the party served that a suit has been
filed against him/her and to required such party to file his/her Written
Statement of defence within the  prescribed time.  Considering all the
above I find that the summons in this case were effectively received by
the Applicant Company on 21st September 2007 which was therefore the
effective date of service.

The Applicant must also show that he has a prima facie defence to the
Respondent's claim.  Court's discretionary power is intended to promote the
ends of justice.  In Jannadas Sodha Vs Gordhandas Hemraj (1952) 7 ULR 11.
Justice Ainley  stated:

    "-The nature of the action should be considered, the defence if one has
    been brought to the notice of the Court, however irregularly, should be
    considered, the question as whether the  plaintiff  can  reasonably  be
    compensated by costs for any delay occasioned should be considered  and
    finally --- it should always be remembered that to deny the  subject  a
    hearing should be the last resort of the court---."


Reference was made to the above statement with approval  in  Sebei  District
Administration Vs Gasuhali & Others (1968) EA 300.

In the instant case the Respondent, Kabuye Victoria, filed the suit against
the Applicant, Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd. and Harriet Nansikombi Kawalya
Kagwa.  She described herself as a Treasurer on the Board of Directors of
the Uganda Women's Christian Association of Uganda and states that she is
suing on the board's behalf vide a Board Resolution dated 6th September
2007.  The Respondent's claim in the plaint is that on 4th February 2006
she opened up an account with the Applicant No. 014420250300 with a clear
mandate of how the account was to be operated which includes the President
of the Board of Directors, the Treasurer of the Board of Directors and the
Executive Director who is the principal signatory to the Account.  The
respondent contends that the Applicant deliberately refused to operate the
Account in accordance with the mandate thereby causing the Association
inconveniences, embarrassments, financial loses and damage.
The applicant had on 4th October 2007 filed a Written Statement of Defence.
 The same copy is annexed to A. Reza Kalan's affidavit in support of the
application.  The Applicant therein denies owing the respondent any duty or
any legal relationship to the Respondent.  The Applicant contends that it
only has a fiduciary relationship with YMCA as an account holder and is a
trustee to the Association's funds with a duty to ensure the proper
operation of its account.  That it has lawfully and rightfully blocked the
operation of the account in line with its own obligations.

The nature of the case involves very serious issues relating to the
management and administration of funds of a public organisation.  It
involves serious principals of banking relating to the bank-customer
relationship. The duties and obligations of a bank towards its customer.
It also involves the issue of Respondent's locus in filing this suit.  I
agree with Mr. Rexida that these are serious matters which deserve to be
resolved on merit.  In Fr. Francis Payer Vs Kawalya Mwebe and Others HCCS
No. 194/ 94 (1995) IV KALR 143 Kireju J. having  found that it was apparent
that the defendant were in fact served with the summons to enter appearance
went on to hold that justice however, required defendants who had shown an
interest in being heard be given the opportunity.  In the instant case the
Applicant's Managing Director became aware of the existence of the suit
against the Applicant on 21st September 2007.  He on 25th September 2007
without any delay, instructed M/S Nangwala Rexida & Co Advocates to file
the Applicants Written Statement of Defence which was done on 4th October
2007.  The conduct of the Applicant's Managing Director and lawyers clearly
show that the applicant is interested in being heard.

All in all I find this an appropriate case where the exparte judgment
should be set aside.  Therefore the exparte judgment against the Applicant
in H.C,.C.S. No. 753 of 2007 is hereby set aside and the Applicant is
granted leave to file a Written Statement of Defence.  The applicant is
awarded costs of this application.
