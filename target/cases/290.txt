BEFORE:  THE HON. MR. JUSTICE GEOFFREY KIRYABWIRE.

J U D G M E N T:

The Plaintiffs claim against the defendant is for the recovery of  US$43,838
being the cost of salt supplied to the defendants but  not  paid  for.   The
plaintiff also seeks general damages for breach of contract.

The defendant in their written statement of defence generally deny that the
said money is owing or that indeed any relationship existed between the
plaintiffs and the defendants.

This case has a long history in the courts since 2001.  The original plaint
was struck-out which led to an appeal being lodged at the Court of Appeal.
 The appeal was allowed and then sent back to the High Court to be tried by
another Judge.
When the matter was set for hearing counsel for the defendant Mr. Kituuma-
Magala sought leave to withdraw from the conduct of the case as he had lost
contact with his client and so lacked instructions to continue with the
defence.  Leave to withdraw was granted and an order made that the
defendants be given notice to attend court by way of substituted service.
The defendants in spite of proof of service failed to attend court and
court ordered that the case proceed ex parte.  Although at the original
hearing the trial Judge then ordered that two key witnesses for the
plaintiff give their evidence  by affidavit, as the two were permanently
leaving Uganda, which they did I directed that further oral evidence be
taken about this transaction and dispute.  Three issues were then set down
for determination;
Whether the defendant did any business with the plaintiff?
Whether a sum of US$43,838 was outstanding and owing from the said
business?
What remedies are available to the parties.

Mr. Y. Mugenyi appeared for the plaintiff.

Issue No. 1:       Whether the defendant did any business with the
plaintiff?

This issue arose as a result of the fairly general defence that the
defendant pleaded.

The plaintiff called four witnesses namely; Mr. Stephen Settabi (PW1), the
plaintiff's Store Keeper; Mr. Bharat Suchak (PW2) an Accountant of the
plaintiffs, Mr. Suni Patel (PW3) who at the time was the plaintiff's Malaba
Depot Manager and Mr. Stephen Mulabi (PW4) a Clearing Agent who cleared
goods for the defendant.  Mr. Settabi testified that he used to load salt
on the defendant's trucks identified as UAB 535 E, UAB 360 K and UAA 397 Q
and get representatives of the defendant to sign delivery notes exhibited
in court as exhibits P.1(i) - (XIX).  Mr. Bharat Suchak testified that the
defendant would make payments for the salt supplied to him and provide the
plaintiff with bank deposit slips exhibited to court as Exh. P.3 (i-XIV).
Mr. Mulabi testified that he used to clear the consignment of salt that the
defendant would buy from the plaintiff at Malaba.

This evidence as it stands is uncontroverted.  Clearly without more it is
very evident that the plaintiff and the defendant had a business
relationship, a fact I now find.  The defence in this respect was a mere
denial which amounts to nothing.

Issue No. 2:     Whether a sum of US$43,838 was outstanding and  owing  from
                the said business?

Mr. Suchak testified that the two plaintiff companies  work  together.   M/S
Mombasa  Salt  Works  Ltd  exports  salt  from  Kenya   while   M/S   Global
Distributors Ltd distributes it.  As both company's Accountant  he  tendered
in as an exhibit the defendants statement  of  account  P.ID  28  (unsigned)
which showed that the  defendant  had  an  unsettled  amount  of  US$47,800.
However  of  this  amount  in  the  statement  the  plaintiff  was  claiming
US$43,838 as still unpaid.  Once again this evidence is unchallenged  I  see
no reason not to believe it.  I accordingly find that  the  defendant  still
owes the plaintiff US$43,838.



Issue No. 3     Remedies

As stated above I find that the claim of special damages of US$43,838 as
proved and I accordingly award it.  The plaintiffs also claimed general
damages for breach of contract.  However, counsel for the plaintiff did not
address me as to the appropriate quantum.  I accordingly award US$5,000 as
general damages.

The plaintiff also prays for interest on both special and general damages
at 25% p.a. from the date of filing the suit.  I find the figure of 25%
interest on the United States Dollar as too excessive.  I would award
interest at 6% p.a. on the award of special damages from the date of filing
the suit until payment in full and 3% p.a. on the award of general damages
from the date of judgment until payment in full.  I also award costs.

JUDGE
