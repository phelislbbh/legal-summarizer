  Applicant/Plaintiff

Versus

DFCU Ltd
         Respondent/Defendant

Legislation referred to:
Land Act







BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The applicant is seeking a temporary injunction to restrain  the  respondent
from selling or otherwise dealing with the suit property comprised  in  Plot
No. 15 Kashari Block 18 Folio 8 Volume 2514 Mbarara until  the  hearing  and
determination of the main suit. Ten grounds  have  been  put  forth  on  the
notice of  motion  in  support  of  this  application.  The  application  is
supported by an affidavit sworn by the  applicant  and  is  opposed  by  the
respondent which has filed an affidavit in reply.
The facts of this case are not substantially in dispute. The applicant's
husband, Mr. Frank Baine Bitamazire, is the registered proprietor of the
suit land. Mr. Frank Baine Bitamazire, granted powers of attorney over the
suit land to Bainebitamazire Mixed Farm Ltd, which company in 2002
mortgaged to the respondent the suit property as security for a loan
granted to Bainebitamazire Mixed Farm Ltd. The husband and the applicant
are directors in the said company, and the applicant also serves as the
secretary. The mortgage deed was signed by the applicant as a
director/secretary of Bainebitamazire Mixed Farm Ltd. The applicant also
executed a personal guarantee for the loan advanced to Bainebitamazire
Mixed Farm Ltd.
 The applicant has now come to this court for interim relief. She wants
this court to issue a temporary injunction restraining the respondent from
exercising the power of sale under that mortgage as the mortgage is
contended to be a nullity. All the 10 grounds set forth in the notice of
motion can be summarised to the effect that the applicant contends that the
suit property is the family home that cannot be mortgaged without the
express prior written consent of a spouse as provided under Section 39 of
the Land Act, before its amendment by the Land (Amendment) Act, 2004. As
she did not provide the prior written consent in a prescribed form, this
mortgage is a nullity.
It is now settled that that where a party seeks a temporary injunction
before determination of the main suit, that party must, firstly, show that
it has a prima facie case. Secondly that it stands to suffer irreparable
loss should the injunction not be granted. And in case of doubt, the matter
can be resolved on a balance of convenience.
In order to succeed on this application the applicant must demonstrate that
she has a prima facie case, or at least an arguable one. At this stage, as
no trial has taken place the court is not required to evaluate the case in
detail or assess at great length the probability of success of the same.
However, the court must be able to be satisfied that there is some serious
question to be investigated.
It is worth considering at this stage that in this case, as director and
secretary of the mortgagor, Bainebitamazire Mixed Farm Ltd, the applicant
was the actual 'mind' of the mortgagor, together with her husband, the
other director. She, in effect, together with her husband, was the mind
that mortgaged the suit property. Did she require any consent from herself
as a spouse to Bainebitamazire Mixed Farm Ltd or at all? I would think not
but perhaps this is a question that will be fully explored, argued and
decided at the trial of the main suit.
Nevertheless given that scenario I am unable to find that the applicant has
made out a prima facie case for the grant of a temporary injunction. I find
that this application has no merit whatsoever. I dismiss the same with
costs.
Signed, dated and delivered in Kampala this 19th day of September 2007
