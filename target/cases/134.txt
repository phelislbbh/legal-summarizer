                            THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA  IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGANDA AT KAMPALA\ (COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION)  HCT-00-CC-MA-0203 OF 2007 (ARISING FROM HCT-00-CC-CS-0166 OF 2002)   EDWARD KABUGO SENTONGO ..................... ........................ PLAINTIFF  VERSUS  BANK OF BARODA AND 2 OTHERS ................................... DEFENDANT   BEFORE: HON. MR. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA  RULING: This is an application by Chamber Summons under  Section  98  of  the  Civil Procedure Act, Order 6 rules 19 and 31 of the Civil Procedure Rules  seeking orders that:  Leave be granted to the plaintiff to amend the Plaint in Civil Suit No. 166 of 2002. Costs of the application be in the cause.  The grounds for the application are that:-  The former Counsel for the Applicant M/S Kabugo & Co Advocates who drafted the plaint failed and/or neglected to clearly disclose some material facts concerning the purported transaction in issue.   The former counsel for the Applicant  failed  and/or  neglected  to  clearly disclose  that  there  was  no  duly  executed  mortgage  deed  between  the Applicant and the 1st Respondent and that there was  no  valid  formal  loan agreement between the 1st Respondent and Olympic Stores Ltd.  The Applicant's former Counsel, failed and or neglected to clearly bring out the impropriety of the purported foreclosure of the Applicant's property by the 1st Respondent.  The  amendment will not occasion injustice to the  Respondents This application is made bonafide upon discovering the omissions on the part of the applicant's former Counsel.   The application is supported by an affidavit deponed  to  by  the  applicant Edward Kabugo Sentongo.  He therein  re-states  the  grounds  as  summarized above.  In paragraph 4 of the affidavit the applicant also  avers  that  his former lawyers did not clearly disclose that he was only a guarantor of  the loan facility advanced to Olympic Stores Ltd by the 1st  defendant  and  not the borrower or recipient of  the  said  loan.   He  avers  that  the  above shortcomings in his pleadings were discovered by his  current  lawyers  upon interviewing him and perusing the plaint and who advised  him  to  seek  the said amendment.  Annexed is a copy of the original plaint  marked  Annexture "KE1" and the Proposed Amended Plaint marked Annexture "KE2."  Mr. Medard Lubega, counsel for the applicant, submitted that the Original Plaint (Annex KE1), did not clearly disclose some material facts.  That such material facts are disclosed in the Proposed Amended Plaint (Annex KE2). He went ahead to point out he said material facts.  The 1st Respondent filed an affidavit in reply deponed to by Mr.  Pramond Singhvi, its Chief Manager.  Three reasons are given therein for opposition of the application, namely:-  The amendments being sought introduce new matters. The amendment if allowed will cause grave injustice to the 1st Respondent bank which injustice cannot be compensated for by costs. The applicant's or his lawyer's negligence ought not to be visited on the respondent and should not frustrate the due process of law.  Otherwise the averments deponed to in the applicant's affidavit that he was only a guarantor of the loan facility and not a borrower; there was no duly executed mortgage deed between the applicant and the 1st Respondent and that there was impropriety of the foreclosure of the Applicant's property by the 1st Respondent were neither denied nor rebutted.  The 2nd Respondent, Robert Opio and the 3rd Respondent, the Registrar of Titles, did not file any affidavit in reply nor appear at the hearing. However, as was pointed out by Counsel for the applicant, the intended amendment does not affect the case of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.  Regarding amendment of pleadings Order 6 rule 19 of the Civil Procedure Rule says:       "The court may, at any stage of the proceedings, allow either party  to     alter or amend his or her pleadings in such manner and on such terms as     may be just and all such amendments shall be made as may  be  necessary     for the purpose  of  determining  the  real  questions  in  controversy     between the parties."   As regards principals to be followed in  considering  whether  to  allow  an amendment or not Tsekoko JSC in Gaso Transport Services (Bus) Ltd Vs  Martin Adla Obene S.C.C. A. No. 4 of 1994 stated:       "The following principles appear to  be  recognized  as  governing  the     exercise of discretion in allowing amendments:- The amendment should not work injustice to the other side.  An injury  which can be compensated by the award of costs is not treated as an injustice. Multiplicity of proceedings should be avoided as far as possible and all amendments which avoid such multiplicity should be allowed. An application which is made malafide should not be granted. No amendment should be allowed where it is expressly or impliedly prohibited by any law- (e.g. limitation of actions).  The above principles are more elaborately set out by Ntabgoba PJ in Edward Seninde Vs Fred  Luwaga (1995) IV KALR 149.  As a general rule amendment of pleadings should be freely allowed at any stage of the proceedings where Court is satisfied that the amendment will enable the real question in controversy between the parties to be adjudicated upon and no injustice would be occasioned to the opposite party. There are, however, exceptions like where the amendment will substantially change the cause of action into a different one or will deprive the defendant of an accrued right or where it is made mala fide, in which case Court will not grant it.  Mr. Magezi, Counsel for the 1st Respondent, argued that there was undue delay in bringing this application for amendment.  This suit was filed on 11th April 2002 and this application was filed on 2nd April 2007, after a period of five years.  However, the court record shows that at one stage there was an appeal to the Court of Appeal, Civil Appeal No. 72 of 2002 arising out of this suit wherein all proceedings in this court were stayed pending final disposal of the appeal.  The appeal was disposed of on 30th August 2005.  The suit is now at the stage of a scheduling Conference.  No evidence has yet been adduced by either side.  Justice Tsekoko JSC in Gaso Transport Services (Bus) Ltd Vs Martin Adala Obene (supra) referred  to a number of cases and held  that amends can be allowed at any stage of the proceedings, even on appeal, only that belated application to amend places a heavy burden on the applicant to convince the Court why he never applied earlier.  In the instant case the applicant's lawyers who drafted and filed the pleadings were M/s Kabugo & Company Advocates.  It was at the above mentioned appeal level that M/s Lukwago & Company Advocates, the applicant's current lawyers, came on board to represent the applicant. There was a stay of proceedings until 30th August 2005 when the appeal was disposed off.  That partially explains the delay.  Also   in his affidavit in support, the applicant avers that upon interviewing him subsequently and perusal of the plaint his current lawyers discovered the shortcomings in the pleadings and advised him to apply for the amendments sought.  To deny an application to amend pleadings merely on the ground that the application was made belated would amount to denial of justice. The principle is to do substantial justice and not to punish the party on technical grounds.  The duty of Court is to decide the rights of parties and not to punish them for mistakes they make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in accordance with their rights. See Cropper Vs Smith (1833) 26 Ch D. 700 at page 711, AIR Commentaries, the Code of Civil Procedure Vol. 3, 10th  Ed page 130.  Further Mr. Magezi argued that the amendment sought is inconsistent with the original pleadings.  He stated that in the original pleading the Applicant admits having signed the mortgage and guarantee but that in the proposed amended plaint the applicant pleads that he was made to sign a purported mortgage deed.  Counsel submitted that this introduces a new cause of action based on involuntary signature.  In the alternative Counsel proposed that if the amendment is to be allowed, the amendment should exclude the element of involuntariness of signature.  In paragraph 9 the plaint claimed:-       "9 On or about the 12th day of March  1998  the  1st  plaintiff  signed     mortgage and guarantee in the 1st Defendant bank  at  Plot  18  Kampala     Road securing a specified loan facility of  Ug.  Shs.40,  000,000/=  to     Olympic Stores Limited repayable in one year."   While in paragraph 7 of the Proposed Amended Plaint it is claimed:-      "7 On or about the 9th day of April 1998, the Plaintiff was  also  made     to sign a  purported  mortgage  deed  which  reflected  the  said  loan     facility of Ug. Shs. 40,000,000/= but was neither  signed  by  the  1st     Defendant bank nor the intended borrower M/S Olympic Stores Limited ----     --"   Mr. Lubega argued that word "purported" in the amendment  was  not  used  in denial of the  applicant's  signature.   He  submitted  that  it  should  be construed as casting doubt on the document which goes  to  the  legality  of the mortgage. Counsel further submitted that the  question  of  legality  of the mortgage was not a new claim.  I have studied the pleadings in both plaints. The phrase in issue is "-the plaintiff was made to sign a purported mortgage deed" instead of the original phrase "--- plaintiff signed the mortgage and guarantee-. " The statement in the proposed amended plaint brings the circumstances of signing as well as the legality of the mortgage in issue.  I agree with Mr. Magezi that an amendment which questions the circumstances in which the Applicant had signed the mortgage has the effect of introducing a new cause of action.  Such amendment cannot therefore be allowed.  Mr. Magezi also submitted that paragraph 14 of the Proposed Amended Plaint when read together with paragraph 13 thereof introduces a new cause of action.  The paragraphs state:      "13. By the time the said purported mortgage  was  allegedly  executed,     the said property had an incumbrance of a caveat, vide instruction  No.     KLA 187953 which was lodged by Jennifer Kabugo, wife of  the  plaintiff     on the  9th  of  May  1997,  forbidding  any  transaction,  dealing  or     registration of any instrument affecting the estate or interest in  the     land at Kyaddondo, Block 208 Plot 14, Kawempe until written  notice  is     given to her. ----       14. The said caveat was removed  without  any  proper  notice  and  the     plaintiff shall contend that its  removal  by  the  2nd  defendant  was     illegal and not in compliance with the Registration of Titles Act."   In paragraph 12 of the Original  Plaint  the  Applicant  contends  that  the endorsement of the mortgage was illegal and  not  genuine.   Therefore,  the illegality of endorsement of the mortgage  is  not  a  new  claim.   In  the proposed amended plaint the Applicant gives the details  or  nature  of  the illegality.  It does not thereby introduce a new cause of action.  All in all the application to amend the Plaint is allowed on condition  that the Amendment does not state that:         "the plaintiff was made to sign "  and does not refer to the mortgage deed as        "purported."  The Amended Plaint to be filed within 7 days.  The order as to  costs  shall be bound by the order as to costs in the main suit. I so order.                        Hon. Mr. Justice Lameck N.
