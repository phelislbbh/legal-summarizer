(Arising from HCT-00-CC-CS- 621 of 2006)

SIRAJE KASUMBAKALI.................................APPLICANT

                                   VERSUS

CAIRO INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD..........RESPONDENT

                BEFORE:     HON. MR. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA

RULING: 2

This is an application by Notice of Motion under Order 9 rule 12,  Order  51
rules 6 and 29 and Order 51 rules 1 and  3  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Rules
seeking orders that:-

The exparte judgment passed against the Defendant/Applicant be set aside
and the suit be fixed for hearing on its merits.


The Applicant be granted extension of time to file a  written  statement  of
defence out of time.
The costs of the application be provided for.

Order 9 rule 12 CPR provides:

    "Where judgement has been passed pursuant  to  any  of  the  preceeding
    rules of this  Order  or  where  judgment   has  been  entered  by  the
    registrar in cases under Order L of these Rules, Court may set aside or
    vary the judgment upon such terms as may be just."

Order 50 rule 6 CPR Provides:-

    "Where a limited time has been fixed for doing any act  or  taking  any
    proceedings under these Rules or by order of the Court, the Court shall
    have power to enlarge the time upon such terms, if any, as the  justice
    of the case may require, and the enlargement may  be  ordered  although
    the application for it is not made until after the  expiration  of  the
    time appointed or allowed, except that the costs of any  application to
    extend the time and of any order made on the application shall be borne
    by the parties making the application, unless the Court shall otherwise
    order."


Under Order 9 rule 12 CPR the Court is given  unlimited  discretion  to  set
aside or vary judgment.  This is in contrast  with  rule  27  where  Court's
discretion is limited to  the  applicant  showing  sufficient  cause.   See.
Nicholas Roussos Vs Gulamuhussein Habils Virani &  Anor  S.C.C.A.  No  9  of
1993, Sebei District Administration Vs Gasyali  & Other (1968)  EA  300,  E.
Zikampata Vs Uganda Libya Trading Co Ltd (1979) HCB 52.

However, the discretion in rule 12 can only be exercised where judgment has
been passed pursuant to any rule of the Order preceeding the rule or by the
Registrar under Order 50.  In Roussos Vs Virani (above) the Supreme Court
stated:-

    "It seems to us that  the  preceeding  rules  referred  to  in  rule  9
    pursuant to which judgment may be entered are rr 4, 5, 6, 7, only."

That is the present rules 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Order 50 rule 2 provides:

    "In uncontested cases  and  cases  is  which  the  parties  consent  to
    judgment being entered in agreed terms, judgment may be entered by  the
    registrar"


The brief background to this application is that on 11th  October  2006  the
Respondent, Cairo International Bank Ltd, filed Civil Suit No. 621  of  2006
against the Applicant , Siraje Kasumbakali  to  recover   Shs.  86,667,258/=
being the amount outstanding on a loan advanced by the   Respondent  to  the
Applicant; general damages, interest and costs.  Pursuant  to  an  order  of
this Court of 12th January 2007 to serve the summons by substituted  service
an advert of the said summons was placed in  the  New  Vision  Newspaper  of
22nd January 2007.  In default of filing  a  Written  Statement  Defence  an
interlocutory judgment was entered by the Registrar of this  Court  on  21st
February 2007 under Order 9 rule 8 of the  Civil  Procedure  Rules  and  the
suit was set down for formal proof.  Hearing proceeded on  26th  April  2007
in the absence of the Applicant and the case is pending judgment.

The Applicant, on 15th October 2007 filed this application seeking, inter
alia, the interlocutory judgment to be set aside and the suit be fixed for
hearing on merits.    The judgment having been entered pursuant to rule 8
of Order 9 is one of such judgments which Court has a wide discretion to
set aside under rule 12.  However, that discretion must be exercised
judicially considering the facts, circumstances and merits of the
particular case.  In Ruossos Vs Viran (supra) their Lordships of the
Supreme Court considered the test upon which the exercise of the discretion
under the rule was to be based.  They quoted from the Kenyan case of Kimari
Vs Mc Connel (1966) EA 547 where Harris J. formulated the test as follows:

    "Whether in light of all the facts and  circumstances  both  prior  and
    subsequent and of the respective merits of the  parties,  it  would  be
    just and reasonable to set aside or vary the judgment if necessary upon
    the terms to be imposed-"


While referring to the above test with approval Duffers P  in  Patel  Vs  EA
Cargo Handling Services (1974) EA 75 at page 76 said:

    "I also agree with this broad statement of principle  to  be  followed.
    The main concern of the Court is to do justice to the parties  and  the
    Court will not impose conditions itself to fetter the  wide  discretion
    given it by the rules"



This application was strongly opposed by  Mr.  Tumusiime,  Counsel  for  the
Respondent.  He referred to Order 5 rule 18 (2) CPR which states:-

    "(2) Substituted service under an  order  of  the  Court  shall  be  as
    effectual as if it had been made on the defendant personally"

By order of this Court summons were by  substituted  service  advertised  in
the New Vision Newspaper of 22nd January 2007.   Such  service  was  to  the
general public, the Applicant inclusive.  Pursuant to Order 5  rule  18  (2)
CPR, above, the applicant is deemed to have been personally served with  the
summons.  In  paragraph  4  of  the  Respondents  affidavit  in  reply,  the
deponent Osama Darwish states that  all  efforts  were  made  to  serve  the
Applicant with summons but  that  he  had  deliberately  refused  to  accept
service.  Annexed thereto and marked A is  Musisi's  affidavit  of  service.
By such annexture the affidavit of service became part of the  affidavit  in
reply. In the  annexed  affidavit  of  service  Musisi  Stephen,  a  process
server, states that on 30th October 2006 he was directed to the  Applicant's
place of business known as "Our shop for Class and  Elegance"  at  shop  No.
104 Charm Towers Kampala Road where he found one Farouk, who was  introduced
to him as the manager of the shop, with whom he left the  summons.   Further
in paragraph 6 of his affidavit in reply  Darwish  states  that  he  had  on
several occasions talked to the Applicant on phone and told him of the  suit
pending against him.  The above averments are neither denied nor rebutted.

In the circumstances I find that even if he was to be believed as he states
in paragraph 8 of his affidavit in support that he did not read the New
Vision Newspaper of 22nd January, 2007, the uncontraverted Respondent's
evidence on oath show that the applicant was otherwise aware of the suit
pending against him.  Despite such awareness the Applicant does not give
any reasons for his failure to file a Written Statement of defence.

However, Court's prime duty is to ensure that justice is done.  There is
need to consider the nature of the Respondent's claim in the main suit and
the nature of the Applicant's defence to the claim.
In Jannadas Sodha Vs Gordhandas Hemraji (1952) 7 ULR 11 Justice Ainley
stated as follows:
    "---The nature of the action should be considered, the defence  if  one
    has been brought to the notice of Court, however,  irregularly,  should
    be considered, the question as whether the plaintiff can reasonably  be
    compensated by costs for any delay occasioned should be considered  and
    finally---- it should always be remembered that to deny the  subject  a
    hearing should be the last resort of the Court--"


The above statement was referred to by Justice  Sheridan  with  approval  in
Sebei District Administration Vs Gasyari & Others (Supra).  In  Fr.  Francis
Payer Vs Kawalya Mwebe & Others HCCS No. 194/94 (1995) IV KALR  143  Justice
Kireju had found that it was apparent  that  the  defendants  were  in  fact
served with the summons to enter appearance.  Her  Lordship,  however,  went
on to hold that justice required defendants who had  shown  an  interest  in
being heard be given the opportunity.

The Respondent's claim in the main suit, which is a bank institution, is
that it extended a credit facility to the Applicant of Shs120,000,000/= at
an interest rate of 21.065%  per annum.  As security for the same the
Applicant mortgaged his property comprised in FRV 398 Folio 16 Plot 811
Close Lane, Lubowa. The Applicant defaulted on the payment terms and the
said property was advertised for sale to realise the loan.  The Applicant
liability was at Shs139, 594,000/= but the property was sold on open market
at Shs43, 000,000/= leaving an outstanding balance of Shs86, 664,258/=.
Thus the suit to recover the balance, general damages and interest.

In his affidavit in support of the application, the applicant states that
prior to granting of the credit facility the mortgage property had been
valued by M/S Ideal Surveyors Valuers and Real Estate Management Consultant
and its unencumbered open market value put at Shs180,000,000/=.  The
Applicant contends that he has a good defence to the effect that:-

The loan facility was adequately serviced by the property comprised in FRV
398 Folio 16 Plot 811 Lubowa.
The realisation of the security at under value contrary to the open market
value entitles him to a set off.

The Applicant's intended defence alleges illegalities and irregularities
and fraud on the part of the Respondent.  In Miscellaneous Application No
660 of 2007, which also arose from this suit serious allegations of fraud
are made against the Applicant which this court cannot overlook.  The
nature of the Respondent's claim in the main suit and the Applicant's
defence raise serious matters of fraud, illegalities and irregularities
which call for proper investigation inter parties.

Mr. Tumusimire submitted that the plaintiff's case had progressed to the
level of pending judgment.  That is appreciated; however, the Respondent
can be compensated in costs for the delay.

Considering all the above the application is allowed. The exparte judgment
and proceedings are set aside.  The applicant is granted leave to file a
Written Statement of Defence within 7 days from the date of this ruling.
In light of the circumstances surrounding this application the costs
occasioned to the Respondent by this application shall be borne by the
Applicant. I so order.




                      Hon Mr. Justice Lameck N. Mukasa
Judge
