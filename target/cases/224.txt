Editors Summary  Following the December 1997 Kenyan general election, the First Respondent was declared the winner of  the presidential elections with the Appellant coming in second. The results of the elections were  published in the Kenya Gazette  Page 116 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  number 79 of 1998 dated 5 January 1998. On 22 January, the Appellant filed a petition in the High Court  challenging the validity of the First Respondents election as president of Kenya. As well as the First  Respondent, the electoral commission of Kenya and its chairman, were named in the petition as  additional Respondents. Notice regarding the filing of the petition against the three Respondents was  purportedly served through the publication in the Kenya Gazette of 29 January 1998 by the Appellants  advocates of notice number 395 dated 22 January 1998. The said notice further directed the three  Respondents to obtain copies of the petitions from the deputy registrar of the High Courts office. The  Respondents thereafter appointed advocates to act on their behalf and to obtain copies of the petition  from the court registry. On 25 January 1999, the First Respondent applied for the petition against him to  be struck out on the ground that he had not been served within 28 days of the publication of the election  results as required by section 20 of the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act. The following  day, the Second and Third Respondents filed a similar notice of motion seeking identical orders to those  sought by the First Respondent. As well as relying on section 20 of the National Assembly and  Presidential Elections Act, the Second and Third Respondents also sought to rely on the provisions of  Rule 14 of the National Assembly (Election Petition) Rules to support their application that the petition  be struck out. Section 20 provided that a petition had to be presented and served within 28 days after the  date of publication of the election results in the Gazette whereas Rule 14 of the National Assembly  (Election Petiton) Rules provided that notice of the petition together with a copy thereof were to be  served within ten days of the presentation of the petition. Rule 14(2) further provided that where no  address was given for service under Rule 10, notice could be published in the Gazette stating that a  petition had been presented and that the Respondent could obtain a copy from the registry. The two  motions were heard together by a bench of three judges of the High Court, which allowed the  applications and struck out the petition. The Appellant appealed against both rulings primarily on the  grounds that the High Court had refused to follow various principles set out in previous Court of Appeal  decisions, that those principles would have worked in his favour and that, by its refusal, he had been  deprived of his established rights. The two appeals were consolidated by consent of all the parties.  Held  The High Court had no power to overrule the Court of Appeal and was bound by the principles of  precedent and stare decisis. Though it had the right and the duty to critically examine the decisions of the  Court of Appeal, it was obliged to follow those decisions unless they could be distinguished from the  case under review on some other principle such as obiter dictum; Cassel and Co Ltd v Broome [1972] 1  All ER 801 and Dodhia v National and Grindlays Bank Ltd [1970] EA 195 approved.  In order to rule on the disputes before them in Chelaite v Njuki and Murathe v Macharia, it was not  necessary for the Court of Appeal to determine the issue as to whether section 20 and Rule 14 were in  conflict. Any pronouncements by the court on this issue in those judgments therefore amounted to  judicial dicta and were not binding on the High Court. Thus, the issue of whether section 20(1)(a) was in  conflict with Rule 14(1) was still open to the High Court to discuss in this petition. There was no reason  to differ with the High Courts conclusion that Rule 14 was in direct conflict with section 20(1)(a) and,  accordingly, did not apply to petitions concerning that section.  Page 117 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  The National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act (Chapter 7) and the rules made thereunder  formed a complete regime with regard to election petitions and no other legislation or rules could apply  unless made applicable by the Act or Rules. Though section 20(1)(a) did not prescribe any particular  mode of service, the best form of service was personal and the courts were obliged to go for that form of  service. Though the Appellant had contended before the High Court that the massive security  surrounding the First Respondent precluded personal service, no effort to serve him had been made and  repelled. Moreover that was a reason that could not have been offered for the failure to serve the Second  and Third Respondents. The Appellant had therefore failed to comply with section 20(1)(a) and the  appeals would be dismissed.

The Appellant in both appeals  is Mwai Kibaki who is the leader of the official opposition in Parliament. The Respondent in civil appeal  number 172 of 1999 is Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, the president and commander-in-chief of the armed  forces of the Republic. We shall hereinafter refer to him as the First Respondent. There are two other  Respondents in civil appeal number 173 of 1999. They are S M Kivuitu and the Electoral Commission of  Kenya; we shall hereinafter refer to these latter two as the Second and Third Respondents respectively.  The Second Respondent is the chairman of the Third Respondent. The Third Respondent is a body  created by section 41 of the countrys Constitution and by virtue of section 42A of the Constitution the  Third Respondents functions are tabulated to be:  (a) the registration of voters and the maintenance and revision of the register of voters;  (b) directing and supervising the presidential National Assembly and local government elections;  (c) promoting free and fair elections;  (d) promoting voter education in Kenya; and  (e) such other functions as may be prescribed by law.  It is clear from this tabulation that the Third Respondent and its chairman the Second Respondent are  crucial to the democratic system of governance that Kenya, like all other emerging democracies is  struggling to put in place. We said from the outset that the parties involved in the two appeals are persons  of no mean status in our Republic. That must be apparent from the short description we have so far given  to each one of them. We only need to add that the two appeals were consolidated by the consent of all  parties.  The Republic of Kenya held its last general elections on 29 and 30 December 1997. At those elections  the Appellant and the First Respondent were among the candidates who contested for the office of the  president. The result of the presidential elections was published in the Kenya Gazette number 79 of 1998  and dated 5 January 1998. The First Respondent was declared the winner with 2 445 801 votes. The  Appellant was the runner-up with 1 895 527 votes.  Pursuant to section 44 of the Constitution, the Appellant, on 22 January 1998, filed in the High Court  election petition number 1 of 1998 to challenge the validity of the First Respondents election as the  president of Kenya. On 29 January 1998 the Appellant had published in the Kenya Gazette notice  number 395 the following and we quote:  The Constitution of Kenya:  The National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act (Chapter 7)  and  Election Offences Act (Chapter 66)  In The High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Election Petition Number 1 of 1998  Between  Mwai Kibaki (petitioner)  Page 119 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  versus  Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi  S. M. Kivuitu  Electoral Commission of Kenya (Respondents)  Notice  To:  Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi  S. M. Kivuitu  Electoral Commission of Kenya  Take notice that an election petition has been presented and filed in the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi, by  Mwai Kibaki, relating to the election of Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi, as the president of the Republic of Kenya  in the presidential elections that took place on the 29 and 30 December 1997. And further take notice that a  true copy of the petition may be obtained by you on application at the office of the registrar/the deputy  registrar, High Court of Kenya, law courts, P.O. Box 30014, Nairobi.  Dated the 22 January 1998.  Pheroze Nowrojee  Advocate for the petitioner  We have found it necessary to set out this notice in full because it was agreed on all sides that this was  the only mode adopted by lodged in the High Court on 22 January 1998.  The First Respondent, in turn appointed Messrs Kilonzo and Company Advocates as his advocates on  2 February 1998. The Second and Third Respondent also appointed their advocates on 3 February 1998.  We assume that before the appointment of Messrs Kilonzo and Company Advocates by the First  Respondent on 2 February 1998, the First Respondent had not pursuant to Rule 10 of the National  Assembly Elections (Election Petition) Rules (the Rules hereinafter), left at the office of the registrar a  writing signed by him or on his behalf, appointing an advocate to advocate in case there should be  petition against him or that he intends to act for himself, and in either case, giving an address in Kenya at  which notices addressed to him may be left where such writing is left with the registrar by an elected  person, all notices and proceedings may be given or served by leaving them at the office of the registrar.  The relevance of these observations will in due course become apparent. We have already said that all  the Respondents were served with the petition through the Gazette Notice of 29 January 1998 and which  notice we have set out in full. On 25 January 1999, one year after the presentation of the petition, the  First Respondent took out a notice of motion which was said to be under section 20 of the National  Assembly and Presidential Elections Act Chapter 7 (the Act hereinafter) and in his motion, the First  Respondent asked for three basic orders, namely:  (1) That the petition be struck out an the ground that the same was not served on the First Respondent  within 28 days after the date of the publication of the result of the presidential election in the gazette or  at all; and  (2) That pending the hearing and determination of this application, all proceedings herein be stayed; and  (3) That the petitioner do pay the cost of the First Respondent in respect of the petition as well as of this  application.  The motion was supported by the affidavit, the First Respondents averments were to this effect:  Page 120 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  2. That a notice of the result of the 1997 presidential election, whereby I was declared to be elected as  president, was published in the gazette on 5 January 1998. I learnt of this fact from the local  newspapers.  3. T hat I have not been served personally with the petition in this case, either within 28 days after the  date of said publication as required by section 20(1) of the National Assembly and Presidential  Elections Act (Chapter 7) or at all.  4. T hat on 2 February 1998, I instructed Messrs Kilonzo and Company Advocates of Nairobi to act for  me in this matter and to obtain a copy of the petition from the court registry.  5. T hat what is stated above is true to my knowledge.  It is thus clear from the notice of motion and the supporting affidavit that the question of service under  section 20(1) of the Act was directly put in issue.  The Second and Third Respondents also joined in the fray and on the 26 January 1999, they also filed  a second notice of motion seeking similar orders as those sought in the motion by the First Respondent.  But the motion by the Second and Third Respondents was stated to have been brought not only under  section 20 of the Act but also pursuant to Rule 14 of the Rules.  Needless to say the two motions were vigorously opposed by the Appellant who in turn filed grounds  of objection and also replying affidavits. The two motions were heard together by Okubasu,  Mbogholi-Msagha and Ole Keiwua JJ and by their ruling delivered on the 22 July 1999, the Learned  Judges acceded to the motions by the Respondents and struck out the Appellants petition. It is that order  striking out the Appellants petition which the provoked the appeal before us.  We started this judgment by remarking that the two appeals before us raise issues very crucial to the  jurisprudence of our legal system as we have hitherto understood it to be. We can now show the  relevance of that remark. In civil appeal number 172 of 1999, the first ten grounds of appeal are as  follows:  1. The High Court overruled the Court of Appeal.  2. T he High Court erred in flouting the first principles of precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis.  3. T he High Court has no power or status to determine whether the decision, reasoning or words of the  Court of Appeal judgments are or are not, rather wide.  4. T he High Court accordingly erred in denying on that basis the Appellant of his lawful orders, and dues  in the High Court.  5. T he High Court cannot deny a party a decision in accordance with the Court of Appeals existing  judgments or conclusions on the basis that it disagrees with those conclusions or judgments.  6. T he High Court was bound by the numerous Court of Appeal judgments and decisions cited and  refusal to follow them has damaged our legal system and has brought it into disrepute.  7. T he High Court was bound by each of the said Court of Appeal judgments and decisions and erred in  allowing the Respondents application to strike out the Election Petition in the face of those judgments  and decisions.  8. I n the High Court the Respondent submitted that the Court of Appeal was wrong in several parts of  several of its said judgments and decisions and the High Court erred and was unprofessional in  entertaining and eventually upholding such flawed and unprofessional submissions.  Page 121 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  9. T he High Court had no jurisdiction so to do.  10. The High Court has acted without and/or in excess of its jurisdiction and powers.  The basic substance to be gleaned from these ten grounds is that there are several decisions of this Court  establishing certain principles of law, that those principles were all in favour of the Appellant, that the  High Court was bound by those principles on the basic of the doctrine of stare decisis, but that in  contumacious violation of that doctrine, namely the doctrine of stare decisis aforesaid, the High Court set  at nought the principles of law previously established by the Court of Appeal and thus deprived the  Appellant of what was his established right or entitlement at law. If we were to be satisfied that the High  Court did all or any of these things that would constitute a very serious indictment of our judicial system  We would join the Appellant and Mr Nowrojee in asserting and we assert together with them.  (i) That the High Court has no power to overrule the Court of Appeal;  ( ii) The High Court has no jurisdiction to flout the first principles of precedent and stare decisis; and  (iii) That the High Court, while it has the right and indeed the duty to critically examine the decisions  of this Court must in the end follow those decisions unless they can be distinguished from the case  under review on some other principle such as that of obiter dictum if applicable.  The principles of precedent and stare decisis are so well established in the Commonwealth jurisdictions  that even the ever-crusading Lord Denning was hardly able to make any appreciable dent in them. In  Broome v Cassel and Co Ltd [1971] 2 All ER 187, Lord Denning took on the House of Lords in these  words:  Yet, when the House of Lords came to deliver their speeches, Lord Devlin threw over all that we ever knew  about exemplary damages. He knocked down the common law as it had existed for centuries. He laid down a  new doctrine about exemplary damages. He said that they could only be awarded in two very limited  categories, but in no other category; and all the other Lords agreed with him.  This new doctrine has up till now been assumed in this Court as a doctrine to be applied: see McCarey v  Associated Newspapers Ltd; Broadway Approvals Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd; Fielding v Variety Incorporated;  and Mafo v Adams. It was applied by Widgery J in Mason v Associated Newspapers Ltd. But it has not been  accepted in the countries of the Commonwealth. The High Court of Australia has subjected this new doctrine  to devastating criticism and has refused to follow it: see Uren v John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd. The Privy  Council has supported the High Court of Australia in a judgment which marshals with convincing force the  arguments against the new doctrine: see Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren. The Supreme Court of  Canada, together with the Courts of Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia and Manitoba, have repudiated the  new doctrine: see McElroy v Cowper-Smith and Woodman; McKinnon v F W Woolworth Co Ltd and  Johnson; Bahner v Marwest Hotel Co Ltd and Fraser v Wilson. The Courts of New Zealand also declined to  follow it: see Fogg v McKnight. The Courts of the United States of America know nothing of this new  doctrine. They go by the settled doctrine of the common law as to punitive damages and would not dream of  changing it. It is well stated in the Re-statement of the Law of Torts.  This wholesale condemnation justifies us, I think, in examining this new doctrine for ourselves; and I make  so bold as to say that it should not be followed any longer in this country. I say this primarily because the  common law of England on this subject was so well settled before 1964  and on such sound and secure  foundations  that it  Page 122 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  was not open to the House of Lords to overthrow it. It could only be done by the legislature. We say it also  because the counsel who argued Rookes v Barnard accepted the common law as it had been understood for  centuries and did not suggest any alteration of it. Yet the House, without argument, laid down this new  doctrine. If the House were going to lay down this new doctrine  so as to be binding on all our courts  it  ought at least to have required it to be argued. They might then have been told of the difficulties which it  might bring in its wake, particularly when there are two Defendants, as in this case. Next, I say that there were  two previous cases in which the House of Lords clearly approved the award of exemplary damages in  accordance with the settled doctrine of common law. They were Hulton v Jones and Ley v Hamilton. It was  not open to the House in 1964 to go against those decisions. Lord Devlin must have overlooked them or  misunderstood them, for he said that: There is not any decision of this House approving an award of  exemplary damages; and yet there were those two. Finally, I say that the new doctrine is hopelessly illogical  and inconsistent.  Here was Lord Denning at his intellectual best. Not only criticising but refusing to follow the case of  Rookes v Barnard [1964] 1 All ER 367; [1964] AC 1129 which was a decision of the House of Lords, a  court superior to the Court of Appeal of England where Lord Denning, as the Master of the Rolls,  presided, Lord Denning went further to advise other courts below the Court of Appeal not to follow  Rookes v Barnard. Not surprisingly, there was an appeal to the House of Lords from the decision of the  Court of Appeal. Delivering his speech in the House of Lords, Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC, had  this to say, and we quote him:  The fact is, and I hope it will never be necessary to say so again, that, in the hierarchial system of courts  which exists in this country, it is necessary for each lower tier, including the Court of Appeal, to accept  loyally the decisions of the higher tiers. Where decisions manifestly conflict, the decision in Young v Bristol  Aeroplane Co Ltd offers guidance to each tier in matters affecting its own decisions. It does not entitle it to  question considered decisions in the upper tiers with the same freedom. Even this House, since it has taken  freedom to review its own decisions, will do so cautiously. That this is so is apparent from the terms of the  declaration of 1966 itself where Lord Gardiner LC said:  Their Lordships regard the use of precedent as an indispensable foundation upon which to decide  what is the law and its application to individual cases. It provides at least some degree of certainty  upon which individuals can rely in the conduct of their affairs, as well as a basis for orderly  development of legal rules. Their lordships nevertheless recognise that too rigid adherence to  precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development to  the law. They propose therefore to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of  this house as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so. In  this connexion they will bear in mind the danger of disturbing retrospectively the basis on which  contracts, settlements of property and fiscal arrangements have been entered into and also the especial  need for certainty as to the criminal law. This announcement is not intended to affect the use of  precedent elsewhere than in this house.  It is also apparent from the recent case of Jones v Secretary of State For Social Services, where the decision  in Minister of Social Security v Amalgamated Engineering Union came up for review under the 1966  declaration, that the house will act sparingly and cautiously in the use made of the freedom assumed by this  declaration. In addition, the last sentence of the declaration as quoted above clearly affirms the continued  adherence of this house to the doctrine of precedent as it has been hitherto applied to and in the Court of  Appeal  see Lord Hailsham, LC in Cassel and Co Ltd v Broome and another, [1972] 1 All ER 801 at 809g  to j and 810a to c.  Page 123 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  We have found it necessary to extensively quote from these cases in England because they illustrate very  well the kind of problems we are called upon to decide, particularly as regards grounds one to ten in the  memorandum of appeal which we have set out elsewhere in the judgment. It is also worth remarking here  that the 1966 declaration by the House of Lords was adopted by the Court of Appeal from East Africa,  the predecessor of this Court, in the case of Dodhia v National and Grindlays Bank Ltd and another  [1970] EA 195, where it was held that: The Court of Appeal while it would normally regard a previous  decision of its own binding, should feel free in both civil and criminal cases to depart from such  decisions when it appears right to do so.  The Kenya Court of Appeal has steadfastly reminded loyal to this principle and the consequence of  that is that the courts of this country has continued to adhere to the principles of precedent and stare  decisis and that is why we have joined the Appellant and his counsel in asserting the continued adherence  to the principles. We can then now turn to an examination of whether the High Court by its decision  appealed from is guilty of all or any of the grounds listed as one to ten in the memorandum of appeal.  The question that was argued before the High Court was whether section 20(1)(a) of the Act was in an  irreconcilable conflict with Rule 14 of the Rules. Section 20(1) after its amendment by Act 10 of 1997  now reads:  20(1) A petition:  ( a) t o question the validity of an election shall be presented and served within 28 days after the  date of publication of the result of the election in the Gazette;  ( b) t o seek a declaration that a seat in the National Assembly has not become vacant, shall be  presented and served with 28 days after the date of publication of the notice published under  section 18;  ( c) t o seek a declaration that a seat in the National Assembly has become vacant, may be presented  at any time.  ( c) t o seek a declaration that a seat in the National Assembly has become vacant, may be presented  at any time.  Provided that  (i) . . .  (ii) . . ..  Before the amendment of 1997, section 20(1)(a) merely provided that a petition was to be presented  within 28 days but the 1997 amendment introduced another requirement, namely that not only must a  petition be presented within 28 days but that it must also be served within the same 28 days. The issue of  service of the amendment. Rule 14, however, has not been amended and remains as it was in 1997. The  Rule provides:  14(1) Notice of presentation of a petition, accompanied by a copy of the petition, shall within ten days of the  presentation of the petition, be served by the petitioner on the Respondent.  (2) Service may be effected either by delivering the notice and copy to the advocate appointed by the  Respondent under Rule 10 or by posting them by a registered letter to the address given under Rule 10  so that in the ordinary course of post, the letter would be delivered within the time above mentioned,  or if no advocate has been appointed, or no such address has been given, by a notice published in the  Gazette stating that the petition has been presented and that a copy of it may be obtained by the  Respondent on application at the office of the Registrar.  Page 124 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  We have, elsewhere, set out in full the notice published by the Appellant in the Gazette. We also pointed  out that it is likely the First Respondent in particular did not leave with the registrar a writing signed by  him showing who his advocates were and their address in Kenya or that he was to act for himself and  where he could be served. So the Appellant chose to serve all the Respondents through the Gazette notice  and they contended they were entitled to do so under in accordance with Rule 14. The motion by each  Respondent seeking to strike out the petition was predicated on the contention that since the amendment  of section 20(1)(a) of the Act, Rule 14 has become irrelevant as it is in conflict with the section. The  conflict which the Respondents asserted was that section 20(1)(a) requires that the petition be filed and  served within 28 days while Rule 14 provides that it can be served within 10 days after the date of  presentation so that if a party filed his petition say on the 28th day after the publication of the result in  the Gazette, such a party would still have another 10 days from the 28th day to serve the Respondent.  That would be good service under Rule 14, but it would clearly be bad service under the Act.  The Appellant, on the other hand, contended that there was not such irreconcilable conflict between  section 20(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 14. Both in the High Court and before us, Mr Nowrojee, for the  Appellant, relied on the passage of Gicheru JA in the case of Maitha v Said and another [1998] LLR 854  (CAK), where in dealing with the issue of conflict between a statute and rule made thereunder that  Learned Judge says this:  At 302 of the 9 Edition of the Construction of Deeds and Statutes by Sir Charles Odgers, it is stipulated as  follows in connection with interpretation of delegated legislation and in particular the Rules made under an  Act of Parliament:  Rules must be read together with their relevant Act; they cannot repeal or contradict the express  provisions in the Act from which their authority.  If the Act is plain, the Rules must be interpreted so as to be reconciled with it or, if it cannot be reconciled,  the Rule must give way to the plain terms of the Act. Where an Act passed subsequently to the making of the  Rules, is inconsistent with them (sic) unless it was clearly passed with a different object and then the two will  stand together.  The issue in the Maitha case in which these observation were made was whether there was a conflict  between section 23(4) of the Act which provides that: subject to subsection (5) an appeal shall lie to the  Court of Appeal from any decision of an election court whether the decision be interlocutory or final,  within 30 days of the decision and the Rules of the Court of Appeal under which a notice of appeal is to  be lodged within 14 days from the date of the decision and the appeal itself being lodgeable within a  further 60 days from the date of lodging the notice of appeal. Maitha had filed a notice of appeal within  14 days and then lodged his appeal well before the expiry of the 60 days allowed by the Rules of the  Court of Appeal but outside the 30 days prescribed under section 23(5) of the Act. The majority of the  Court, which included Gicheru JA, had no difficulty in holding that the appeal was incompetent as it had  been lodged outside the period allowed by the Rules. The Rules had to give way to the plain provisions  of the statute and that is what is set out in the passage from the ruling of Gicheru JA which we have  quoted.  Page 125 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  The Appellants contention, however, was that the Court of Appeal itself had decided in at least two  cases that there was in fact no conflict between section 20(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 14. These cases are  Chelaite v Njuki and others [1998] LLR 2184 (CAK) and Murathe v Macharia [1998] LLR 2233 (CAK).  In Chelaites case, Kwach JA, is recorded as saying:  Assuming for the purposes of argument only that Rule 14(1) is in conflict with section 20(1)(a) of the Act  then under the ordinary canons of statutory interpretation, the provisions of the Act must prevail. I am  satisfied that Parliament has properly exercised the powers given to it by section 44 of the Constitution and  that there is no conflict between that section of the Constitution and section 20(1)(a) of the Act. I am equally  satisfied that in dealing with the issue of service under section 20(1)(a) of the Act rather than leaving it to the  rules committee, Parliament acted within its legislative authority and did not unsurp the power of the rules  Committee. As a matter of construction Rules 14(1) can still be reconciled with section 20(1)(a) of the Act  and there is really no conflict between the two provisions.  Earlier on, the Learned Judge of Appeal had said and we once again quote him:  All that section 20(1)(a) of the Act says is that a petitioner must present and serve his petition within 28 days  from the date of publication of the result of the election in the gazette. In fixing the date of presentation of the  petition the petitioner must make sure not only that service is effected on the Respondent within ten days as  required by Rule 14(1) of the Rules, but also that this is done within twenty eight days, from the date of  publication of the result of the election in the gazette. So in effect presentation is governed by publication of  the result while service is governed by presentation and both these steps must be taken within twenty eight  days.  The late Pall JA was the second member of the court in Chelaites case and for his part he had this to say:  I do not find any conflict in section 20(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 14 of the Rules and in case there be any  conflict then section 20(1)(a) of the Act, being an Act of Parliament must prevail over Rule 14 which is a  subsidiary legislation. Similarly I do not find any conflict in section 44(4) of the Constitution and section  23(3) of the Act and in case of any conflict section 44 of the Constitution will supersede section 23(3) of the  Act by virtue of section 3 of the Constitution.  The third member of the court, Owuor JA, originally had reservations of her own, but in the end, she  agreed with the other members of the court and concluded:  In the course of argument, I was inclined to think that there was indeed a conflict between section 20(1)(a)  of the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act Chapter 7 and Rule 14(1) of the National Assembly  Elections (Election Petition) Rules, but on reflections and having read my brothers judgments, I am satisfied  that there is none. The efficacy of Rule 14(1) has not been affected by the amendment of section 20(1)(a) of  the Act introduced by Act number 10 of 1997.  So the Appellant is fully justified in saying that in the Chelaite case, the Court of Appeal had held that  there was in fact no irreconcilable conflict or any other conflict between section 20(1)(a) of the Act and  Rule 14(1) of the Rules. That now brings us to the case of Murathe v Macharia ante, and the members of  the court once again included Kwach and Pall JJA, the new member being Tunoi JA. This time round  Kwach JA said:  The result of the election was published in a special issue of the Kenya Gazette dated 6 January 1998 and for  the purposes of section 20(1)(a) of the Act twenty eight days allowed for presentation and service of petitions  started to run on 7 January 1998. So anyone who wished to present a petition had to do so, and also have it  served on or before 3 February 1998, subject to compliance with Rule 14(1) of the National Assembly  Elections (Election Petition) Rules . . ..  Page 126 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  The Learned Judge of Appeal still made it clear that not only had a petitioner to comply with section  20(1)(a) of the Act but also with Rule 14. And Pall JA repeats:  But to me there seems to be no conflict. As the electorate of the constituency in particular and Kenya in  general are entitled to know as soon as possible as to who has been validly elected from that particular  constituency, Parliament in its wisdom has cut down the period of 38 days previously allowed for the  presentation and service of petition to 28 days. The two provisions can easily be reconciled. The period of 28  days now is the over-all period within which a petition must not only presented but also served and, not going  beyond this period of 28 days Rule 14(1) says the petition must be served within 10 days of the presentation.  The Learned Judge of Appeal was clearly still of the view that there was no conflict between the Act and  the Rule.  Tunoi JA, the new member in the decision, was obviously not happy with this view, but he did not  dissent from it. He says in his judgment:  In my view it is a fallacious contention to aver that only the Act was amended but the Rules remained intact,  for if it were so that legislative intent would have been devoid of concept of purpose and would have reduced  the amendment to futility. Further, since election petitions have elaborate procedures of their own relating to  filing and serving election petitions the Civil Procedure Rules and or any other statutes should not be applied  when computing time . . ..  Like Owuor JA in the Chelaite case, Tunoi JA also had his doubts on the issue but the relevant fact is  that none of them dissented. So once again the Appellant is right in contending that the Court of Appeal  had held in this case too that there is in fact no conflict between section 20(1)(a) of the Act and Rule  14(1) of the Rules.  How then, did the High Court deal with these cases which were expressly cited to them? We think we  can only turn to their ruling to find out what they said about the cases. We quote them:  We see the core issue to be decided in the Chelaite v Njuki case as being whether service of the petition was  good given the fact that it was effected outside the twenty eight days period provided under section 20(1)(a)  of the Act but within the ten days provided under Rule 14 of the Election Petition Rules. The other matters  were obiter dicta which do no bind this Court.  It is apparent from this passage that the Judges of the High Court who decided the matter at the very least  know that they are bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal. But it is also apparent that they equally  know that if the Court of Appeal purports to decide a matter which does not fall for consideration in a  particular case, that is, a matter which it is not necessary to decide in order to arrive at a decision  disposing of the particular case, then they are not bound by such a side decision. That is why they are  saying that the other remarks made by the Court of Appeal in the Chelaite case were not binding on them  because those remarks constituted what the lawyers designate as obiter dicta (plural) or obiter dictum  (singular). In Chelaites case the High Court was asked to strike out the petition on the ground that it was  served outiside the 28 days prescribed by section 20(1)(a) of the Act. In the view of the High Court, to  decide that issue it was not necessary to decide the question of whether section 20(1)(a) was in conflict  with Rule 14. It was agreed in both the Chelaite case and the Murathe case that service of the relevant  documents upon the Respondents in those cases had been effected outside the 28-day period prescribed  Page 127 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  under the Act. The question of whether the Act was in conflict with the Rules did not, accordingly, arise  and was irrelevant to the decision. Aluoch J who decided the Chelaite case in the High Court did not at  all purport to consider the issue of whether or not there was a conflict between the two provisions. Nor  did Mr Ochieng Odhiambo who represented Chelaite throughout the whole case ever purport to contend  that there was in fact a conflict. Mr Odhiambos contention both in the High Court and in the Court of  Appeal was to the effect that section 44 of the Constitution only gave Parliament the power to make  provisions dealing with the circumstances and manner in which, the time within which, and the  conditions upon which a petition may be filed in the High Court and also the powers, practice and  procedure of the High Court in relation to petitions. Mr Odhiambo had argued from these provisions that  Parliament was not entitled to prescribe the period within which a petition had to be served and that in  prescribing the period of 28 days for service in section 20(1)(a) Parliament was exceeding the authority  conferred on it by the Constitution. That argument was obviously for rejection and was rightly rejected  by both courts. But the point we are making is that the question of whether section 20(1)(a) of the Act  was in conflict with Rule 14 was never raised in the High Court. It was also not raised in the High Court  in the Murathe case, but even if it had been raised, it would have really been unnecessary to decide it  since it was irrelevant to the issue of the petitions being incompetent for having been filed outside the 28  days prescribed by section 20(1)(a). That is why the three Learned Judges of the High Court who decided  this petition thought they were not bound by the holdings in the Chelaite and Murathe cases  they said  the holdings were obiter. We were referred to Halsburys Laws of England (4 ed) Volume 26 paragraph  573 which deals with the question of the ratio decidendi in a decided case. It is therein stated:  The enunciation of the reason of principle upon which a question before a court has been decided is alone  binding as a precedent. This underlying principle is called the ratio decidendi, namely the general reasons  given for the decision or the general grounds upon which it is based, detached or abstracted from the specific  peculiarities of the particular case which gives rise to the decision. What constitutes the binding precedent is  the ratio decidendi and this is almost always to be ascertained by analysis of the material facts of the case, for  judicial decision is often reached by a process of reasoning involving a major premise consisting of a  pre-existing Rule of law, either statutory or Judge-made, and a minor premise consisting of the material facts  of the case under immediate consideration.  Our understanding of this passage is this. In the case of Chelaite, for example, the major premise was  section 20(1)(a) which lays down that a petition must be filed and served within 28 days from the  publication of the election result in the Gazette. Chelaite filed her petition within the 28 days but she  served it outside that period. That was the minor premise existing of facts. Then it was contended that the  petition was incompetent because though presented within the prescribed period of 28 days, it was  incompetent because it was served outside the prescribed period. This contention was upheld by the High  Court and the Court of Appeal and the petition was struck out as incompetent. What would constitute the  general principle, the ratio decidendi, which would be applied in all subsequent cases, is that since  section 20(1)(a) of the Act prescribes 28 days as the period within which a petition must be served, a  petition which is served outside that period is incompetent and must be struck out. It is this general  principle, which would be binding on the courts. There will of course be other  Page 128 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  conclusions within the main decision, such as whether section 20(1)(a) is in conflict with Rule 14 and so  on but these are what are designated as obiter dicta and these are not binding. Halsbury puts it like this at  paragraph 574:  Dicta: Statements which are not necessary to the decision, which go beyond the occasion and lay down that  it is unnecessary for the purpose in hand are generally termed dicta. They have no binding authority on  another court, although they may have some persuasive efficacy. Mere passing remarks of a Judge are known  as enunciations of the Judges opinion on a point not arising for decision, and so not part of the ratio  decidendi, have been termed judicial dicta . . ..  Like the three Judges of the High Court, we also agree that in deciding the question of whether the  petitions in Chelaites and Murathes cases were incompetent or not, it was not necessary to decide the  issue of whether or not section 20(1)(a) of the Act was in conflict with Rule 14. We agree that the  pronouncements made in the two cases to the effect that section 20(1)(a) is not in conflict with Rule 14  amounted to no more than judicial dicta and were not binding on the High Court.  We were also referred, on the same point, to the second case of Murathe, namely Murathe v Macharia  civil appeal number 25 of 1999 (unreported) which was presided over by Gicheru, Tunoi and Shah JJA,  but that appeal involved a petition which had been filed pursuant to section 20(1)(c) of the Act for a  declaration that a seat in the National Assembly had become vacant. Such a petition can be filed at any  time and section 20(1)(c) was not affected by the amendments brought in by Act 10 of 1997. Rule 14  would still be applicable to that section. The Judges of the High Court were only considering whether, in  view of the amendment to section 20(1)(a), Rule 14 could still apply to that section. The second Murathe  case is, with respect, irrelevant to the issue at hand. Shah JA, in the second Murathe appeal, correctly  distinguished the difference between section 20(1)(a) and 20(1)(c) insofar as service of the petition is  concerned.  We are ourselves satisfied that the issue of whether or not section 20(1)(a) was in conflict with Rule  14(1) was as it were, still terra rosa and therefore, still open to the High Court to discuss. We so find  and hold and in view of that, grounds one to ten in the memorandum of appeal number 172 of 1999 must  accordingly fail.  The High Court considered the issue of whether or not section 20(1)(a) of the Act was in conflict with  Rule 14(1) of the Rules and the Learned Judges came to the conclusion that the two provisions were in an  irreconcilable conflict with each other. That conclusion is questioned in both appeals and we must deal  with it. Section 20(1)(a) lays it down that a petition must be presented and served within 28 days after  publication of the result of an election in the Gazette. It is agreed on all sides that presentation and  service under the section must be within 28 days and any service done outside that period is invalid and  the petition itself is rendered incurably defective. That is the ratio decidendi in the cases of Chelaite and  Murathe. Rule 14(1), however, says expressly that service of the notice of presentation of a petition  accompanied by a copy of the petition shall, within ten days of the presentation of petition, be served by  the petitioner on the Respondent.  If the two provisions are not in conflict with each other, then our understanding of the position is that  each of them must be given its full application. The Rule binds a petitioner to lodge and serve the petition  within ten days  Page 129 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  from the date of lodging the petition. If this Rule is to be given its full application then it would mean  that a petitioner who lodges a petition on the 20th day, for example, would still be entitled, under the  Rule, to ten days from that date which would carry the matter to the 30th day. The Rule can only be  reconciled to the Act by deducting some days from the ten days given by it (the Rule) or by making sure  that the petition is filed within an earlier period as would allow a period of 10 days to run. As the  Learned Judges of the High Court correctly point out, if the provisions of the Rule were to be given their  full application, then the cases of Chelaite and Murathe ought not to have been struck out because  service of the petitions in those cases fully complied with Rule 14(1) of the Rules. That is why the Judges  say that decisions such as those of Chelaite are examples of the conflict between the two provisions. To  reconcile the two decisions, one has to modify the application of Rule 14(1) and we do not know that a  court is entitled to modify the provisions of a written enactment, whether it be a statute or subsidiary  legislation. We once again quote Gicheru JA in Maitha v Hemed ante:  Rules must be read together with their relevant Act; they cannot repeal or contradict express provisions in  the Act from which they derive their authority. If the Act is plain the Rule must be interpreted so as to be  reconciled with it, or if it cannot be reconciled with it, or if it cannot be reconciled, the Rule must give way to  the plain terms of the Act. Where an Act passed subsequently to the making of the Rules is inconsistent with  them, the Act must prevail unless it was clearly passed with a different unless it was clearly passed with a  different object and then the two will stand together.  As we pointed out earlier, the conflict being considered in the case above was between section 23(3) of  the Act which provides that an appeal to the Court of Appeal must be lodged within 30 days from the  decision against which the appeal is brought, and the Rules of the Court of Appeal. Rule 74(1) of the  Court of Appeal Rules provides for the giving of the notice of appeal within 14 days from the date of the  decision while Rule 81(1) provides that the appeal itself is to be lodged within 60 days from the date of  lodging the notice of appeal. The appeal by Maitha, as we pointed out earlier, was lodged outside the 30  days prescribed under section 23(3) of the Act but within the 60 days. The majority of the Court   Gicheru and Omolo JJA  had no difficulty in holding that the appeal was incompetent and there was no  question of attempting to reconcile the provisions of section 23(4) of the Act with those of the Court of  Appeal Rules. The Court of Appeal Rules were in conflict with the provisions of the statute and they (the  Rules) had to give way to the plain words of section 23(4). We see no difference between the position in  the Maitha case ante, and the one now under consideration. We accordingly agree with the High Court  that section 20(1)(a) of the Act is in direct conflict with Rule 14 and that being so Rule 14 must give way  to the plain words of section 20(1)(a) of the Act. Accordingly, Rule 14 of the Rules can no longer apply  to petitions which concern section 20(1)(a) of the Act. Indeed, under section 20(1)(a) of the Act, all that  one needs to serve is a copy of the petition but we would have no quarrel with it if a party chose to  include an unnecessary document like a notice of presentation, which, for the purposes of section  20(1)(a) of the Act is really irrelevant.  We can now discuss the mode in which an election petition is to be served. We agree with Mr  Norwojee and Mr Orengo that the Act and the Rules both form a complete regime and other legislation or  Rules can only be applicable to  Page 130 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  election petitions if they are made applicable by the Act itself or the Rules. We also agree that the  purpose of the regime is to have election petitions dealt with in as quick a manner as is reasonably  possible and the reason for this is not difficult to understand. The voters in a particular constituency and  also the general voters in Kenya are interested in knowing who their legitimate representative in  Parliament is. We are in entire agreement with the principles set out in the ancient case of County of  Tipperary which was decided way back in 1875 and we agree that the principles enunciated in that case  are embodied in our Rules. Those principles, however, cannot answer for us the question of how service  of a petition is to be effected.  Section 20(1)(a) which we have extensively dealt with merely says that a petition shall be presented  and served within 28 days. We have held that Rule 14 can no longer apply to petitions file pursuant to  section 20(1)(a) of the Act. Mr Orengo pointed out to us, rightly in our view, that section 20(1)(a) does  not say who is to be served and how service is to be effected. On the issue of who is to be served, we  very much doubt if a party who has taken a great deal of trouble to draw up a petition would be ignorant  as to the person or persons against whom he is complaining and the reliefs he seeks from that persons  against whom petitions are brought are the correct parties is, of course, a wholly different issue.  Section 20(1)(a) sets out what is to be served  a petition. It (the section) also says when the petition  is to be filed  within 28 days from the date of publication of an election result. The period within which  it is to be served is also the same period. Parliament, however, has not stated in the section how the  service is to be effected. Under Rule 10 of the Rules:  A person elected may at any time after he is elected send or leave at the office of the Registrar a notice in  writing signed by him or on his behalf appointing an advocate to act as his advocate in case there should be a  petition against him or stating that he intends to act for himself, and in either case giving an address in Kenya  at which notices addressed to him may be left or if not such writing is left all notices and proceedings may be  given or served by leaving them at the office of the registrar.  It is obvious from this Rule that it is not mandatory for a person elected to do any of the things set out in  the Rule. The expression is that A person elected may not that A person elected shall. So that we  have a situation in which the only provision in section 20(1)(a) is that a petition is to be presented and  served within 28 days from a certain event. Rule 10 does not compel an elected person to leave his  address or that of his advocate with the registrar. If he was compelled to do so, then one would be  entitled to assume that service can be effected on him at the address left with the registrar and if no  address is left, they by leaving the documents with the registrar. We think we should state at this stage  that if the amendments of 1997 had not intervened the question of the mode of service was well settled  and even in the other cases brought in after the amendments, the issue of any conflict between section  20(1)(a) of the Act and Rule 14 of the Rules had not been raised. We have already dealt with this aspect  of the matter and we need not repeat ourselves. Where Parliament simply says that a party is to be  served without specifying how the service is to be effected, what does it (Parliament) mean or intend?  In ordinary language, to serve a person with a document is to deliver that document to that person. For  example, Order 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules deals with service of summons in ordinary civil case. Rule  7 deals with mode of  Page 131 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  service and is to the effect that: Service of the summons shall be made by delivering or tendering a  duplicate thereof signed by the Judge, or such officer as he appoints in this behalf, and sealed with the  seal of the court.  Rule 9 and (2) of Order 5 of the Civil Procedure Rules deal specifically with service on a party or his  agent. The general tenor of service under this Order is that unless there is an appointed agent or unless a  Defendant cannot be found service is normally personal. Exceptions only come when personal service is  not practicable.  We would add this with regard to service of petitions upon an elected person. Service by way of  publication in the Kenya Gazette, in view of section 20(1)(a) of the Act, cannot be proper service. The  publication in the Gazette, as in this case, directs a respondent to obtain a copy of the petition from the  office of the registrar/deputy registrar of the High Court of Kenya. In view of the fact that section  20(1)(a) requires presentation and service of the petition asking a respondent to collect a copy thereof  from the High Court registry cannot be proper service. This is yet another aspect which shows that Rule  14(1) is in conflict with section 20(1)(a) of the Act.  Mr Nowrojee also cited and made available to us the Parliamentary Election Petition Rules of 1868 of  England. Rule 14 of those Rules was to the effect that:  Where the Respondent has named an agent or given an address, the service of an election petition may be by  delivery of it to the agent, or by posting it in a registered letter to the address given at such time that, in the  ordinary course of post, it would be delivered within the prescribed time.  This Rule is similar to our Rule 10, so that if an address of the advocate or the Respondent himself is left  with the registrar then service may be effected on the advocate or at the address given. But of more  interest is the commentary found immediately under the English Rule 14 which we have set out:  In other cases, service must be personal on the Respondent, unless a Judge, on an application made to him  not later than five days after the petition is presented on affidavit showing what has been done, shall be  affidavit showing what has been done, shall be satisfied all reasonable effort has been made to effect personal  service and cause the matter to come to the knowledge of the Respondent, including when practicable, service  upon an agent for election expenses, in which case, the Judge may order that what has been done shall be  considered sufficient service, subject to such conditions as he may think reasonable.  It is agreed on all sides that election petitions are not ordinary civil suits; as Mr Nowrojee submitted  before us, an election petition is a dispute in rem, though of course it must, of necessity, be fought out  between or amongst certain named parties. They are disputes of great importance to the public but some  specified person or persons still have to answer to certain alleged defaults. How is it then, that in  ordinary civil litigation the parties concerned have to be served in person unless it is impossible to find  them when other modes of service may be adopted?  The question arose that if only personal service would suffice, the Respondents would seek to evade  service by, for example, travelling out of the country or just staying out of sight until after the expiry of  the prescribed 28 days. That fear may be genuine but it must also be remembered that election petitions  Page 132 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  generally involve Kenyans who very much prize their title of Honourable and we do not contemplate  that those involved in petitions will wilfully take cover in order to avoid the process of the law.  What we are saying, however, is that election petitions are of such importance to the parties  concerned and to the general public that unless Parliament has itself specifically dispensed with the need  for personal service, then the courts must insist on such service. We cannot read from section 20(1)(a)  that Parliament intended to dispense with personal service. Even under Rule 14(2) of the Rules personal  services was not dispensed with. The other modes of service were only alternative modes of service to  personal service. That is why in the various other cases quoted to us personal service was always  described as the best form of service. Section 20(1)(a) of the Act does not prescribed any mode of service  and in those circumstances, the courts must go for the best form of service which is personal service.  Before this Court, the Appellant did not offer any reason why he did not go for personal service though  in the High Court, it had been contended that the First Respondent in his capacity as the president, is  surrounded by a massive ring of security which it is not possible to penetrate. But as the Judges of the  High Court correctly pointed out, no effort to serve First Respondent was made and repelled. In any case  that reason could not be offered in respect of the Second and Third Respondents. The Second and Third  Respondents are themselves not elected persons in terms of Rule 10 of the Rules though they are truly  Respondents within the Rules and the long-standing decision of the court in Mudavadi v Kibisu and  another [1970] EA 85. But though the Second and Third Respondents are Respondents they cannot take  advantage of Rule 10 of the Rules because that Rule is only available to elected persons, so that the  Second and Third Respondents could not have provided the registrar with their or their advocates  addresses in Kenya. That being so, the Appellant had to serve them in accordance with section 20(1)(a)  of the Act and as we have said, that had to be personal service.  In the event, we are satisfied the three Learned Judges of the High Court were fully justified in  holding that as the law now stands only personal service will suffice in respect of election petitions filed  under section 20(1)(a) of the Act. It may be unjust, but so is section 6 of the Land Control Act Cap 302  which once made Apaloo JA (as he then was) lament in the following words:   A sold agricultural land to B. The former was unco-operative in getting B to obtain the consent of the  land control board. A however obtained full payment of he purchase price and duly put B into possession.  On the faith of this sale, B spent a large sum of money in developing and improving the land. Ten years  afterwards, A motivated by the prospect of obtaining higher price for the land sells the self-same land to C  then with A s active co-operation, hurriedly obtained consent (this in one day) and thereafter registered his  title. C then proceeds to ask B s eviction from the land. Without the aid of section 6(2) of the Act, C will  be held entitled to evict B. Indeed Awould be entitled to say to B: Yes I accept that I sold the land to  you, obtained full payment of the consideration money and put you in possession for 10 years and you may  well have developed the land. But I say that an Act of Parliament entitles me to resell to C and you must be  content with the return of the purchase price you paid me ten years ago. To think such a thing could be  possible offends against ones idea of propriety and fairness.  See Wamukota v Donati [1986] LLR 2306 (CAK) in Court of Appeal judgments civil appeals 1986  Volume II.  Mr Justice Apaloo was appalled that the kind of thing he set out could happen, but it did happen in the  case in which he spoke and it still continues to  Page 133 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  happen to this day. As Kwach JA says in Chelaite, Parliament in its wisdom, and it is forever wise, can  and often does decree certain things which may not seem wise to persons unschooled in its way of doing  things. But the courts must accept the wisdom of Parliament, unless, of course, they are contrary to the  provisions of the Constitution. It has decreed in section 20(1)(a) that service of election petitions must be  personal and whatever problems may arise from that, the courts must enforce that law until Parliament  should itself be minded to change it.  We shall conclude this judgment by briefly touching on Mr Nowrojees complaint that in applying to  the High Court to strike out the Appellants petition, the Second and Third Respondents were abusing the  process of the Court. The Second and Third Respondents, it was contended, had, in two previous cases,  one at Nakuru and another one at Mombasa, taken a position diametrically opposed to the position they  took in this petition. The Second and Third Respondents are by law required to be impartial and they  ought not to be perceived as taking a particular position in support of a particular candidate. We agree  with Mr Nowrojee that Second and Third Respondents must always remain impartial. We said at the  beginning of this judgment that the Second and Third Respondents are crucial to the democratic process  Kenya is evolving. The High Court did not itself say anything about this aspect of the Second and Third  Respondents abusing the process of the court. For out part, we would say this. The Second and Third  Respondents must remain impartial in matters of elections. The law binds them to be impartial. But when  they are sued and allegations of impropriety or wrong-doing are made against them, then they must  somehow challenge those allegations. If they are sued, then they become parties to the suit in which they  are sued, and as parties surely they must be partisan in the defence of their interest. They are, in the  position of parties, entitled to make whatever submissions to a presiding Judge or Judges. That is how the  adversarial system of justice operates. We would, however, state that once a party has, in a previous case,  taken a particular stand on an issue of law, then good practice would demand that if the position  previously taken is being changed, the party ought to disclose that a contrary view had been previously  taken and argued, but that there had been a change and the reason or reasons for the change stated. Mr  Kapila, in the High Court merely termed the submissions of Mr Nowrojee as being harsh while not  offering any reason why the change was necessary. However, the High Court did not find it necessary to  decide the issue, and Mr Kapila cannot be blamed for that. Had the High Court been unaware of the  previous position taken by the Second and Third Respondents and it was only discovered later, then in  those circumstances the Second and Third Respondents could be legitimately accused of misleading the  court. But as it is, we do not think it would be right to hold that the Second and Third Respondents  failure to put forward a defence to their conduct during the hearing of the application amounted to an  abuse of the judicial process.  We have said enough, we think, to show that all the grounds listed in the two appeals do not convince  us that we should allow the appeals. Although there were in total in the two appeals, 173 grounds argued  before us in groups, we are satisfied that in our judgment we have dealt with all of them. To have  considered each and every ground separately would have made this judgment much longer than it is. We  think each of the grounds has found its place in the judgment.  Page 134 of [2000] 1 EA 115 (CAK)  Before we leave the matter, we must commend the advocates for the very able manner in which they  advanced arguments for their respective clients before us. Their learned and very detailed submissions  have made our task in writing the judgment that much easier. We are greatly indebted to them.  In the event, our final order in civil appeal number 172 of 1999 is and shall be that the appeal is  dismissed with costs certified for two counsel.  As regards civil appeal number 173 of 1999, while we dismiss the same, we are not inclined to award  any costs to the Second and Third Respondents. They have taken inconsistent stands on the matters  falling for consideration and neither here nor in the superior court did they offer any valid reason for  changing their position. The order which accordingly commends itself to us is that civil appeal number  173 of 1999 be dismissed but with no order as to the costs thereof. We would further order that the order  for costs awarded to the Second and Third Respondents in the High Court is also set aside and the result  of that is that there will be no costs to the Second and Third Respondents both here and in the High  Court.  Those shall be our orders in the two appeals.
