liquidator, in accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Act-Rule 27 of
the Companies (Winding Up) Rules
Brief facts:

petition was opposed by one of the creditors of the company, or the only
creditor so far to respond to that petition, M/S Uganda Revenue Authority,
the tax collection agency for the Government of Uganda. The hearing of the
said petition was held over until an application filed by URA was heard and
disposed of.
Issues:
Whether there was justification to appoint an interim liquidator.
Held:
URA failed to show that there was justification at this stage in the
proceedings to appoint an interim liquidator. Accordingly the application
was dismissed with costs.

            BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

                                   RULING
1. M/S Rankconsult (U) Ltd, hereinafter referred to as the company, filed a
petition for winding up by order of court on the ground that it can no
longer meets its financial obligations. That petition is opposed by one of
the creditors of the company, or the only creditor so far to respond to
that petition, M/S Uganda Revenue Authority, hereafter referred to as URA,
the tax collection agency for the Government of Uganda. The hearing of the
said petition was held over until an application filed by URA was heard and
disposed of. This ruling is in respect of that application.
2. URA applied to this court for appointment of an interim liquidator, in
accordance with Section 238 of the Companies Act. In addition URA seeks
these other orders. 1. A competent and professional firm of auditors be
appointed interim liquidators. 2. The company files its statement of
affairs from the year 2000-2005. 3. Costs of this application and that of
the interim liquidators be provided for.
3. This application is based upon 7 grounds set forth in the chamber
summons which I will reproduce below.
1. The petitioner was a recipient of large sums of money from the Electoral
Commission from which taxes fell due and were payable in 2001/2002 but did
not remit the money. 2. The petitioner engaged the applicant in protracted
negotiations with numerous assurances/ability of its competence/ability to
pay the said amount and the same did not materialise. 3. The petitioner has
in the mean time transferred all its funds from the said accounts to
unknown persons and created floating charges on its properties. 4. The
petitioner has neither filed statements of account with Uganda Revenue
Authority nor the Company Registry and has failed to produce books of
accounts. 5. The petitioner formed a new company in April 2005 and in a
fraudulent preference has transferred the same shares into the names of its
individual shareholders. 6. The petitioner's winding petition is an abuse
of court process. 7. It is in the interest of substantive justice that a
professional firm of Auditors is appointed as interim liquidators of the
respondent company.
4. This application is supported by an affidavit sworn by Mr. Okodi James,
the Manager Debt Collection and Tax Appeals. He states that the Petitioner
owes URA Shs.4, 281,884,492.00 (Four billion, two hundred and eighty one
million, eight hundred eighty four thousand four hundred and ninety two
only) which arose out of a contract with the Electoral Commission. The
petitioner received all its payments from Electoral Commission but failed
to remit the taxes due. The petitioner engaged URA in protracted
negotiations since 2002 until June 2005. URA is now in the midst of an
investigation into the financial affairs of the petitioner and its
directors, and Mr. Okodi contends, it is in the interest of substantive
justice that an interim liquidator is appointed pending the conclusion of
its investigations. The affidavit contains other matters in support of the
grounds set out herein earlier.
5. This application is opposed and an affidavit in reply was sworn by Mr.
Frank Katusiime, the Managing Director of the company. It refutes all
allegations of bad faith, stating that the money it received from the
Electoral Commission, it paid out to other creditors of the company. And
now the company has no cash to pay its tax obligations.
6. Section 238 of the Companies Act states,
'(1) The court may appoint the official receiver to be the liquidator
provisionally at any time after the presentation of a winding up petition
and before the making of a winding up order. (2) Where a liquidator
(hereinafter referred to as interim liquidator) is so appointed by the
court, the court may limit and restrict his or her powers by the order
appointing him or her.'
7. Rule 27 of the Companies (Winding Up) Rules, (hereinafter referred to as
the Rules) provides in part,
'(1) After the presentation of a petition for the winding up of a company
by the court, upon the application of a creditor, or of an contributory, or
of the company, and upon proof by affidavit of sufficient ground for the
appointment of an interim liquidator, the court, if it thinks fit and upon
such terms as in the opinion of the court shall be just and necessary, may
make appointment. (2) The order appointing the interim liquidator shall
bear the number of the petition, and shall state the nature and short
description of the property of which the interim liquidator is ordered to
take possession, and the duties to be performed by the interim liquidator.'
8. Neither the statute nor the rules made there under, detail the
situations that would warrant the appointment of an interim liquidator. It
appears though that the power to do is wide and unrestricted but must serve
some purpose in furtherance of a legitimate objective. What can be gathered
from English case law referred to by counsel is that a provisional
liquidator may be appointed in obvious cases of insolvency or when the
assets of the company are in jeopardy. See Re Highfield Commodities Ltd,
[1984] 3 All E R 884. An interim liquidator may be appointed if it is in
the public interest. See Re Union Accident Insurance Co. Ltd [1972] All E R
1105.
9. Rule 27 (2) of the Rules require that the order for appointment of the
interim liquidator specifically states the nature and short description of
the property the liquidator is ordered to take possession of and the duties
to be performed by the interim liquidator. I presume that this information
must be available on the application if the court is to mention it in the
order it may issue. If this information, that is what property or
properties the interim liquidator is to take possession of, is not
disclosed on the affidavits of the applicant, the court would be unable to
comply with this rule. Similarly, if the applicant does not articulate the
duties that he proposes the interim liquidator should perform, the court is
hand capped, as it cannot issue an order without detailing the duties the
interim liquidator is to perform.
10. Mr. Ssekatawa, learned counsel for URA, submitted that this application
was grounded in public interest, presumably given that what is at stake for
URA is collection of taxes. Mr. Birungyi and Mr. Barata, learned counsel
for the company submitted that no public interest had been made out to
justify appointment of an interim liquidator. They submitted that the
liquidator that would be appointed on the main petition was capable of
carrying out all the functions of the interim liquidator which URA wanted.
11. This application fails to show that there are any assets of the company
that are in jeopardy or assets that the interim liquidator should be
ordered to take possession of anyway. On the contrary its thrust seems to
be that the assets of the company have already been dissipated, dispersed,
or otherwise dealt with. No particulars of these assets are provided. The
immediate task for an interim liquidator is to protect assets of the
company, or the public interest, in case the company is being used to hurt
public interest. It would appear in this case there are no assets to
protect; at least none are disclosed by this application.
12. Mr. Ssekatawa, in his address to court, relied on the public interest
as the ground for appointment of an interim liquidator. This ground was not
articulated in the chamber summons or supporting affidavit. Mr. Ssekatawa
does not show the public interest issues at stake here save presumably that
the URA is engaged in collection of tax revenue. It is not demonstrated how
the appointment of an interim liquidator will protect the recovery of tax
obligations due from the company to URA. All, this court is told, is that
URA is conducting an investigation into the financial affairs of the
company, and URA would like an interim liquidator appointed, pending its
finalisation of its investigations. This request is open ended. It is not
clear what would be the purpose of appointing an interim liquidator given
that URA is conducting its own investigations which could well go ahead,
along side the winding up process.
13. By the very nature of the office of an interim liquidator he or she has
a very limited role in between the presentation of the petition and the
making or refusal of winding up order. The duties of the interim liquidator
must clearly be set forth in the order appointing him. For this to be done,
the applicant should have made mention of the duties the interim liquidator
was to perform in this period. This application has not done so.
14. URA has failed, in my view, to show that there is justification at this
stage in the proceedings to appoint an interim liquidator. Accordingly I
dismiss this application with costs.
