BEFORE:  THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE YOROKAMU BAMWINE

J U D G M E N T:

Akugoba Boda Boda Transport Development Services Ltd, herein after
conveniently referred to as 'Akugoba' where the context allows, is a
Limited Liability company.  It sued the defendant, Sun Auto Company Ltd,
also a Limited liability company, for specific performance by way of
delivery of registration number plates for 20 motorcycles, recovery of a
certificate of title for land, recovery of one motor vehicle, general
damages, interest and costs of the suit.

In its written statement of defence, Sun Auto Company denied dealing with
Akugoba.  It claimed that it had dealt with a one Hajji Swaibu Kizito in
his individual capacity, which Hajji Kizito executed the sale agreement and
offered his own property as security for the debt.
As the hearing came to a close, it transpired that Sun Auto Company had
indeed instituted a separate suit against Hajji Swaibu Kizito which suit
was founded on the same facts.  In that suit, HCCS No. 759/2006, Sun Auto
Company claims a sum of Shs.26,160,000= being the balance due to it out of
the sale  of 20 motorcycles, the subject matter also in HCCS No. 501 of
2006.  In order to save Court's time and because the issues in both cases
revolve around who the correct parties to the contract were, both counsel
proposed, and Court accepted the proposal, that the two suits be
consolidated.  Hence this judgment.

No point of agreement was generated at the Scheduling Conference.  Three
issues were framed for Court's determination in HCCS No. 501/2006:
1.    Whether the plaintiff and the defendant entered into any contract.
2.    The terms of the contract, if any.
3.    Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs sought.

I will answer the same in the context of both suits.

Representations:
Mr. Musoke Suleiman for the plaintiff.
Mr. Kiboneka Richard for the defendant.

First, whether the plaintiff (AKUGOBA) and the defendant (Sun Auto Company
Ltd) entered into any contract.

A contract is simply an agreement enforceable at law. An essential feature
of a contract is a promise by one party to another to do or for bear from
doing certain specified acts.  One party has to make an offer to the other,
who in turn must accept the offer, thus formulating an agreement.  The
agreement may be oral or written.  Where complaints of breach are raised,
as herein, and it so happens that the parties had reduced their agreement
to writing, Courts resort to the said written agreements as an embodiment
of the conditions and terms of the contract.  And this brings me now to the
parol evidence rule.

The parol evidence rule is to the effect that evidence cannot be admitted
(or that even if admitted, it cannot be used) to add to, vary or contradict
a written instrument.  In relation to written contracts, the rule means
that where a contract has been reduced to writing, neither party, can rely
on evidence of terms alleged to have been agreed, which is extrinsic
document, i.e. not contained in it.  This rule is fundamental in
interpretation of contracts.

In the instant case, the basis of the relationship between the parties is a
Sale Agreement, D. Exh. 1.  The opening paragraph runs as follows:
       "On behalf of M/S Sun Auto Company, I  have  transacted  (sold)  the
       above mentioned motor  vehicle/cycle  to  Mr/Mrs/Miss  Hajji  Swaibu
       Kizito c/o Akugoba boda boda Transport Ltd."

In law a company  and  its  Managing  Director  are  totally  different  and
distinct persons.  It is settled law that a  company  is  a  distinct  legal
entity, separate from such persons as may  be  members  of  it,  and  having
legal rights and duties.  It may enter into contracts in its own right,  own
property, pay taxes, employ people and  be  liable  for  torts  and  crimes.
These are fundamental attributes of corporate  personality  recognized  long
ago in Solomon -Vs- Solomon & Co. Ltd [1897] AC 22.

From the agreements, the company, Akugoba, was used merely as the address
of Hajji Swaibu Kizito.  As such, the presumption is that it had no
interest in the transaction.  It cannot incur liability under it or take
advantage of it.  The reason is simple: no stranger to the consideration
can take advantage of a contract although made for his benefit.  Only a
person who is a party to the contract can sue on it.

At the hearing, DW1 Mulinde testified that the person his company
transacted business with was Hajji Swaibu Kizito.  He did not know him or
his company before the incident.  He asked for motorcycles on credit and he
gave him 20 of them.  As security for the payment, Kizito surrendered to
the seller his own certificate of title in respect of land described as
Block 205 Plot 78 Kyaggwe.  On top of that he surrendered to the seller his
own vehicle, a Pajero Reg. No. UAF 238 D.  The two documents are indeed in
the names of Hajji Swaibu Kizito.

From the evidence, Court is satisfied that the transaction was between Sun
Auto Company Ltd and Hajji Swaibu Kizito.  Akugoba was used as Kizito's
contact address.  In all these circumstances, Court makes a finding that
the contract was between those two persons, Sun Auto Company Ltd and Hajji
Swaibu Kizito.

I now turn to the terms of the contract.
Both parties agree that the contract document is what was tendered in
evidence, D. Exh.1.  It is a standard form agreement, with terms and
conditions printed in clear green ink.  They are:
1.    The buyer shall gain  full  ownership  after  paying  the  outstanding
      balance
      and the interest thereof B (iii) and meet the transfer  costs  in  his
      names.
2.    In the event of not fulfilling the  outstanding  balance  the  company
      shall re-posess the  above  mentioned  vehicle/cycle  i.e.  after  the
      elapse of the agreed period and sell it to off  set  the  balance  and
      interest; plus the costs incurred in recovery and the balance shall be
      given to the buyer.
3.    In case of motor cars,
................................................................."

The balance stated  in  the  document  is  Shs.31,  600,000=;  the  date  of
delivery is 18/7/2005; and the agreed period 5 months only.   It  is  argued
for the plaintiff in HCCS No. 501/2006 that the terms were already  written,
favouring the defendant company.  For as long as the terms were  clear,  not
ambiguous, and were duly discussed, I do not see any problem  with  them  to
write home about.

It is further argued that the parties agreed that the defendant would
deliver the number plates of the motor cycles within a period of 14 days.
No such promise appears in the Sale Agreement.  It is trite that where the
contract is in writing, its terms can be ascertained by means of
documentary evidence.  Where they are clear, a Court must give them effect.
 It is therefore not the duty of the Court to re-write an expressly stated
contract for the parties.  As long as both parties address themselves to
the terms of the contract and agree to be bound by them, the duty of the
Court is to construe the agreement as it was when it was executed.

From the evidence of DW1 Mulinde and the Sale Agreement itself, the parties
agreed that the buyer would gain full ownership of the cycles after paying
the outstanding balance.  Evidence about the purported giving out of the
number plates within 14 days is extrinsic document.  It is inadmissible,
and even if admitted, it cannot be used to add to, vary or contradict a
written instrument, D. Exh. 1.

I now turn to remedies.

From the evidence of DW1 Mulinde, which I found truthful, after the
negotiations, Hajji Swaibu Kizito agreed to take the motor cycles on
credit.  DW1 agreed.  Hajji Kizito issued his company's post-dated cheques
to the seller and on top of the cheques pledged his own land and vehicle as
security for payment.  The goods were specific, ascertained and in a
deliverable state.  They were for a stated price.

Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is an
unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable
state, the property in the goods passes to the buy when the contract is
made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of
delivery or both are post poned.  This is subject to the intention of the
parties.  In view of this Court's finding that the agreement of the parties
was that the buyer gains full ownership after paying the outstanding
balance, their intention was that property in them would not pass till
then.  In cases of this nature, certain factors must be considered before
damages can be calculated.  One of these factors is the role of the injured
party following the breach: he is expected to do what he can to look after
his own interest.  He must in other words mitigate his loss.

From the evidence, while Hajji Kizito claims that he had agreed with
Mulinde that number plates would be given to him within 14 days, which he
didn't, he (Kizito) went ahead and in turn sold them to third parties
without the said number plates.  The unpaid for cycles could not therefore
be recovered from Hajji Kizito after the contract period of 5 months.  In
my view, by giving Sun Auto Company Ltd the post-dated cheques which in the
end bounced and by surrendering to the company his own personal property
(the land title and vehicle), Hajji Kizito committed himself to pay for the
cycles on demand.  The company has prayed in HCCS No. 759/2006 that it be
paid a sum of Shs.26, 160,000= being the balance on the purchase price.  In
his evidence, DW1 Mulinde admitted receipt of some payment.  He gave the
outstanding balance as Shs.24,600,000= although, as stated above, the
amount claimed in HCCS No. 759/2006 is Shs.26,160,000=.  PW1 Nabisalu put
the figure at Shs.22, 750,000= and Hajji Kizito himself at Shs.24,
000,000=.  I take the outstanding amount to be the figure admitted by Hajji
Kizito.  Accordingly, the sum of Shs.24, 000,000= is decreed to M/S Sun
Auto Company Ltd as against Hajji Swaibu Kizito.  The decretal sum shall
attract interest at the commercial rate of 25% per annum from the date of
judgment till payment in full.  Given that Hajji Swaibu Kizito has himself
parted with custody of the suit cycles, M/S Sun Auto Company Ltd shall
maintain custody of Hajji Swaibu Kizito's certificate of title and the
vehicle pending payment.  In default, the same shall be sold in execution
to recover the amount due and the balance, if any, shall be given to the
judgment-debtor.

In the final result, judgment is entered for the plaintiff in HCCS No. 0759-
2006 against the defendant therein on the terms stated herein above with
costs as prayed.  HCCS No. 0501-2006 is dismissed with no order as to
costs.  Upon being paid the decretal amount and costs, M/S Sun Auto Company
Ltd shall release the 20 number plates to the judgment debtor.

I so order.
