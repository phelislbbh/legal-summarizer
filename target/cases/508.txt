RULING

The Plaintiff, Yovani Tibakwanika, filed Civil Suit No. 597 of 2006  against
the Defendant, Hajati Yudaya  Nalongo  Namagembe.   Briefly  the  Plaintiffs
claim in the above Suit is that he instituted Civil Suit No. 513 of 1990  in
the Mengo  Chief  Magistrate's  Court  and  obtained  Judgment  against  the
Defendant therein, one Juma Kabongo.  Following that Judgment the said  Juma
Kabongo ran out of Uganda and on the 6th August 1992, the  Defendant  herein
executed an agreement with M/S Rajsid Results Court  Brokers  and  Bailiffs,
the Court Bailiffs appointed to execute the decree in Civil suit Non GK  513
of 1990 whereby the Defendant agreed to pay the sum of Shs.  1,902,840/=  to
the said Court Bailiffs in discharge of the money the said Juma  Kabogo  was
liable to pay under the said case.  The Defendant did  not  pay  within  the
agreed period of four months.  As a result of the Defendants and failure  to
pay the Plaintiff and 3rd October 2006 filed this suit seeking to recover:-
Shs. 7,22,840/=
General damages for loss, damage and inconvenience caused to the Plaintiff.
Exemplary damages because of the Defendant's unlawful, malicious and
unconstitutional acts.
Interest at the rate of 30p from the date of filing the Suit.
Costs of the Suit.

The Plaintiff was represented by Mr. Fredrick Zaabwe.

At the scheduling conference Mr. Eric Mukwezi, Counsel for the Defendant
raised two preliminary objections.  First that the suit was time barred and
second that the plaint did not disclose a cause of action against the
Defendant.  The Order 9 rule 11 provides:

      "The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases -
where it does not disclose a cause of action.
                 ----
where the suit appears

      From the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law.
      ----"

With regard  to  the  limitation  period  Mr.  Mukwezi  submitted  that  the
Plaintiff's claim was based on a Judgment in Civil Suit No. GK 513  of  1990
delivered sometime in 1992.  The instant  suit  was  filed  on  3rd  October
2006.  Counsel referred to Section 3 (3) of the Limitation Act.  It says:-

      "An action shall not be brought upon any Judgment after the expiration
      of  twelve  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  Judgment   because
      enforceable, and no arrears of interest in  respect  of  any  judgment
      debt shall be recovered after the expiration of  six  years  from  the
      date on which the interest because due."

Counsel submitted that this action  is  founded  on  a  Judgment  which  was
enforceable - 1992 and was limited to  twelve  years  which  had  lapsed  in
August 2004.

In the alternative counsel referred to subsection (1) (a) of the same
section which provides that actions shall not be brought after the
expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action arose if
founded on contract.  Continued as a contract the cause of action was
founded on the agreement, annexture A, to the plaint dated 6th August 1992
whereby the Defendant agreed to pay the decretal sum in Civil Suit No. GK
513 of 1990.

Clearly when this suit was filed on 3rd October 2006 the limitation periods
under both sub-sections (1) (a) and (3) of the Limitation Act had long
lapsed.  The provision "shall be rejected" in rule 11 of Order 9 of the
Civil Procedure Rules is mandatory.  In Francis Nansio Micheal -Vs- Nuwa
Walakira [1993] VI KALR 14 the Supreme Court held that clearly if the
action is time barred then that was the end of it.

In his submission Mr. Zaabwe relied on Section 25 of the Limitation Act.
It sates:-

      "Where in the case of any action for which a period of  limitation  is
      prescribed by this Act, either -


the action is based upon the fraud of the Defendant or his or her  agent  or
of any person through whom he or she claims or his or her agent
                 -----
                 the period of limitation shall not begin to run  until  the
                 Plaintiff has discovered the fraud or the mistake or  could
                 with reasonable diligence have discovered it;---."

Counsel referred to paragraphs 6 to 9 of the Plaint.  For clarity I will
reproduce the paragraphs;-

    "6. The Plaintiff shall contend that Juma Kabogo ran out of Uganda  and
        that on  the  6/8/1992,  the  Defendant  under  look  to  pay  shs.
        1,902,840/= to Rapid Results Court Brokers and Bailiffs  and  clear
        J. Kabogo's liability.  A photo start copy of the      document  of
        her undertaking is Annexture A.


7.    The Plaintiff shall contend that soon after executing the above
document the Defendant moved from Kibuye Nkers Zone RC.1 to a place unknown
to the Plaintiff and the Court Bailiffs and that consequence execution of
the Judgment became impossible.
8.    The Plaintiff shall contend that he had no means of knowing the
whereabouts of Juma Kobogo or the Defendant.

9.    The Plaintiff shall contend that it is only in July 2006, that he
learnt the whereabouts of the Defendant."

Counsel argued that the Defendants conduct and acts as pleaded in the  above
paragraphs were fraudulent.  He  therefore  sought  to  rely  on  fraud  and
submitted that the limitation period according to Section 25 above  did  not
being to run until the Plaintiff discovered the fraudulent conduct  or  acts
of the Defendant stated in the Plaint.  In his view this was  in  July  2006
when the Plaintiff discovered the  whereabouts  of  the  Defendant.   As  to
pleadings of fraud counsel contended that:-

Juma Kabogo was under arrest in execution of the Judgment in Civil Suit No.
GK 513 of 1990 and the Defendant obtained his release by making a
representative that she will pay the Judgment debt.  The Defendant made the
representation with full knowledge that she was not going to honour the
agreement.


Juma Kabogo and the Defendant conspired to  defraud  the  Plaintiff  because
immediately after the execution of the agreement  and  after  obtaining  the
release of Juma Kabogo, the Defendant moved  from  her  known  Residence  at
Kibuye Ntere Zone R.C.1 to an unknown place.

Order 6 rules 3 and 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules require that where a
party relies on fraud it must be specifically pleaded.  In this regard Mr.
Zaabwe referred to B.EA Triber Co. -VS- Inder Singh Gill [1979] EA 463
where Forbes, VP at page 469 stated:

      "---It is--- well established that fraud must be specifically  pleaded
      and that particulars of the fraud alleged must be stated on  the  face
      of the pleading.  Fraud, however, is a  conclusion  of  law.   If  the
      facts alleged in the pleading are such as to create a fraud it is  not
      necessary to allege the fraudulent intent.  The  acts  alleged  to  be
      fraudulent must be sent out, and then it should be stated  that  there
      acts were done fraudulently; but from the acts fraudulent  intent  may
      be inferred."


As to the fraudulent intent of the Defendant  counsel  cited  Suleiman  -VS-
Azzan [1958] EA 553 where court held that circumstantial  evidence  suffices
to prove fraud;   In  that  case  court  found  that  the  first  Defendants
admissions compiled with the timing  of  the  transfer  clearly  established
that the first Defendant's object was to put the property out  of  reach  of
his creditor, the Plaintiff; such an object is "unlawful" for  the  purposes
Section 23 of the Contract Decree, both as being "fraudulent" and  as  being
of "such a nature that , if permitted of any law".  Counsel  submitted  that
the Defendants conduct was intended to deny the Plaintiff  the  proceeds  of
the decree in Civil Suit No. GK 513 of 1990  and  to  defeat  Justice,  thus
fraudulent.

Assuming the pleadings in paragraphs 6 to 9 of the plaint amounted to a
plea of fraud the agreement on which the Plaintiff bases his claim was
executed on 6th August 1992.  It is the Plaintiff contention, in paragraph
7 of the plaint, that "soon after execution of the above document the
Defendant moved from Kibuye Nkere Zone R.C. 1 to a place unknown to the
Plaintiff and the Court Bailiffs and that consequence execution of the
Judgment because impossible."  It is not the discovery in July 2006 of the
where about of the Defendant.  It is the disappearance from the known place
of abound which the Plaintiff states was soon after execution of the
agreement.  This was in 1992.  The Plaintiff must have discovered the
alleged fraudulent conduct of the Plaintiff sometime in 1992, which was a
period of fourteen years by October 2006 when this suit was filed.  Thus
within the limitation period blachet.  It is trite that a party is brought
by his/her pleadings.  Order 5 rule 18 of the Civil Procedure Rules
provides a solution where a party can not be traced for service of summons
in the ordinary way, whereby it can be done by substituted service.
Failure to trace a Defendant is no justification for failure to file a suit
against him within the statutory period.  I therefore find that the
Plaintiff's Suit is time-barred.

The second ground of objection was that the plaint did not disclose a cause
of action.  Mr. Mukwezi submitted that the Plaintiff was not a party to the
undertaking on which he bared his claim.  The parties to the undertaking,
annexture 'A' to the plaint, was the Defendant, Hajati Yudaya Nalongo
Namagembe and M/S Rapid Results Court Brokers and Bailiffs.  This was an
agreement executed in execution of the Judgment in Civil Suit No. GK 513 of
1990 whereby the said Court Bailiffs were acting as agents of Court and not
of the Plaintiff.  Clearly the Plaintiff was not a party to the
undertaking.  The Plaintiff had no claim against the Defendant on the basis
of that undertaking.  I accordingly find that the plaint did not disclose a
cause of action against the Defendant.

All in all the plaint is rejected under Order 9 rule 11 of the Civil
Procedure Rules and dismissed with costs.
