BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The applicant was the unsuccessful party in this court. It appealed  to  the
Court of Appeal. Pending the hearing of that appeal it seeks  an  order  for
stay of execution. This application has been made both under Order  22  Rule
26 and Order 48 (presumably 51) Rules 1, 2 & 3 of the Civil Procedure  Rules
and Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Act. This application  is  based  upon
six grounds set out in the notice of motion, and supported by  an  affidavit
sworn by the managing director of the applicant.
The respondent opposes this application and has sworn an affidavit in
opposition.
At the hearing of the application Mr. Tusasirwe, learned counsel for the
applicant submitted that, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in
Tatu Naiga and Co. Emporium v Verjee Brothers (U) Ltd Miscellaneous
Application No. 46 of 2000 (unreported),
           'the main criterion for staying execution should be whether the
           judgment debtor should suffer substantial loss if the decree was
           executed notwithstanding that the decree might be subsequently
           set aside. Where a right of appeal exists, the court, as a
           general rule, ought to exercise its best discretion in a way so
           as to prevent the appeal, if successful, is not rendered
           nugatory'.
Mr. Tusasirwe submitted that the applicant would suffer substantial loss if
the order for stay of execution was not granted as it would be compelled to
part with the decretal amount at this stage and the appeal would be
rendered nugatory.
Mr. Rutiba, learned counsel for the respondent opposed the application.
Firstly he submitted that it had been made under the wrong rules as Order
22 Rule 26 of the Civil Procedure Rules was inapplicable. Secondly that the
applicant had not, on the pleadings and supporting affidavit, established
any ground upon which this application may be considered and granted. He
prayed that the application should be dismissed with costs.
The notice of motion set out the following as the grounds upon which this
application is based.
           '1. That when Judgment in HCCS NO.524 of 2001 was delivered by
           the Honourable the Principal Judge on 22nd December 2003, the
           applicant/defendant promptly filed a notice of appeal against
           the said judgment, and a request for typed proceedings and to
           date, the typed proceedings have never been given to the
           applicant to enable it pursue the appeal.
                                                                         2.
           That in the meantime, on 31st January 2007, the honourable the
           Principal Judge delivered an order in the same matter and
           indicated that the order is to be regarded as part and parcel of
           the earlier judgement aforesaid.


           3. The applicant has, together with this application, filed a
           Notice of Appeal against the said Order of 31st January 2007
           and, a request for typed proceedings.
                                           4. That the applicant/defendant
           has filed also filed herewith an application for leave to appeal
           the order.                                            5. That in
           the meantime, the plaintiff has in record time, already
           extracted a decree and had it sealed, filed two bills of costs
           claiming over 130,000,000.00 in costs and is clearly set to
           execute the Decree swiftly.


           6. The application for leave and the intended appeal has high
           chances of success and it would be unjust to allow execution to
           proceed before the application and appeal are heard and
           determined.'
I'm not sure at what point learned counsel for the applicant, Mr.
Tusasirwe, perused the decisions that he cited to this court but it is
apparent it was long after he had filed his pleadings and evidence in
support thereof. Had he done so, prior to drawing prior to drawing and
filing the applicants' papers it ought to have been clear that this
application could not be maintained under Order 22 rule 26 of the Civil
Procedure Rules, as those provisions were restricted to appeals to the High
Court. Secondly the arguments of learned counsel, however erudite and
apposite on the law in relation to stay of execution have no relation to
the grounds that are set forth in the applicant's notice of motion and
supporting affidavit. As pointed out by Mr. Rutiba, the grounds in the
pleadings were a narration of a story, the story of the intended appeal,
rather than a statement of grounds for a stay of execution of a decree
pending appeal.
The affidavit in support is no different from the notice of motion. All it
basically contains is the story of this litigation, rather than the factual
basis adduced in support of grounds upon which the application for stay of
execution can be considered. Ground 6 of the application, which is perhaps
closest to a possible ground for an application of this nature, claims that
it would be unjust to allow execution to proceed before the appeal is heard
and determined. The nearest piece of evidence to supporting this 'ground'
is the blanket claim in paragraph 22 of the affidavit
           'that if execution is allowed to proceed before the application
           for leave to appeal and the appeal itself are heard and
           determined, the said application and appeal will be rendered
           nugatory and the applicant will suffer enormous loss in hundreds
           of millions of shillings and its property, assets and business
           will be greatly undermined.'
This substantial loss to the property, assets and business of the applicant
is not explained in anyway. It just remains a bare assertion. It is not
whatsoever suggested that the respondent would be unable to pay the
applicant should the applicant succeed against the respondent on appeal,
and the decree is set aside. Neither is it shown that if the
applicant/judgment debtor were to pay the decretal amount now, it would
suffer either substantial loss or irreparable harm. It is expected, I
suppose, that the court must infer this to be the case, in spite of the
fact that no basis for the same is laid.
It is not shown on the application or evidence before me that if execution
were not stayed the appeal would be rendered nugatory in anyway. What the
affidavit of applicant does in this regard is merely to repeat the 'mantra'
in paragraph 22 that this appeal would rendered nugatory without taking so
much as even an iota to explain how the appeal would in the circumstances
of this case be rendered nugatory.
I agree with Mr. Rutiba that the applicant has not set out at all the
necessary grounds upon which this court should consider an application for
a stay of execution. Where the applicant comes nearest to doing so, he does
not do so adequately. This application must fail as it is without merit. It
is dismissed with costs.
Before I take leave of this matter, I am compelled to draw the attention of
counsel to the words of Lord Templeman at Page 488 in Ashmore v Corporation
of Lyod's, [1992] 2 All E R 486 which are equally pertinent to the present
situation.
           'The parties and particularly their legal advisers in any
           litigation are under a duty to co-operate with the court by
           chronological, brief and consistent pleadings which define the
           issues and leave the judge to draw his own conclusions about the
           merits when he hears the case.  It is the duty of counsel to
           assist the judge by simplification and concentration and not to
           advance a multitude of ingenious arguments in the hope that out
           of ten bad points the judge will be capable of fashioning a
           winner.'
