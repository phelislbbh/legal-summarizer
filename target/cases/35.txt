                             Arvind Patel v Uganda                     The Supreme Court of Uganda at Mengo                 Supreme Court Criminal Appeal No. 36 of 2002                 (Arising from Criminal Appeal No. 27 of 2001)                                    Before          Coram: Oder, Karokora, Mulenga, Kanyeihamba, and Kato JJ.SC                               27th October 2003  Criminal Procedure - Conspiracy to murder - Evidence of recorded  audiotapes - Plea of guilt by co-accused in a charge of conspiracy - Whether the  trial conducted by three Trial Magistrates contravened  S.142  of  the  Magistrate Courts Act - Whether it was proper to make an inference of  guilt  from  the guilty plea by co-accused against the Appellant  The Appellant and a one  Andrew  Okello  were  convicted  of  conspiracy  to murder contrary to s. 201 of  the  Penal  Code  by  the  Chief  Magistrate's Court, and sentenced to five years imprisonment. The  facts  briefly  stated that the Appellant and Andrew Okello, between March and April  1998  at  the Railways Goods Shed conspired  to  murder  one  Rahuel  Patel  Alias  Bhikhu Patel, and engaged the services of Sgt. Nsubuga Frank (PW2),  Richard  Jumbo (PW3) and Andrew Odeke (PW4) to achieve their purpose. This  failed  as  the said persons withdrew from the plan  and  instead  reported  the  matter  to police. The Appellant and Andrew  Okello  were  arrested  and  charged  with conspiracy to murder. On 21/08/1998, before  Chief  Magistrate  Ruhinda,  at Buganda Road Court Andrew  Okello   Accused  No.2  pleaded  guilty  and  was convicted  and  sentenced  to  a  fine  of  Shs.500,000/=  or  six   month's imprisonment. He opted to pay the fine. One month later, he died before  the trial of the appellant commenced. The Appellant who was tried alone,  denied participation in the conspiracy, and put up a  defence  of  alibi  that  was rejected and he was found guilty, convicted as charged  and  sentenced.  The trial of the appellant in the magistrate's  court  was  conducted  by  three magistrates. The record shows that Mr. Ruhinda,  Chief  Magistrate  was  the first to handle the case when he took the plea on  22.5.1998,  handled  bail applications, and recorded the plea of guilty of accused  No.  2  Okello  on 26.8.1998.  On  5.10.1998,  Mr.  Ruhinda  disqualified   himself   following allegations of bias. On the same date, Magistrate Grade  one  Isingoma  took over hearing of the case and recorded  evidence  of  the  first  prosecution witness.  On 3.11.1998, Magistrate Grade one Tibulya took over the case  and recorded evidence of the rest of  the  witnesses  and  found  the  appellant guilty. The appellant's appeal to the Court of Appeal  was  dismissed  hence this appeal.  Held,      i) The interpretation of s. 142 (1) of the MCA,  in  Eustance  v  Rep.         [1970] EA in which the number of magistrates  to  hear  a  case  in         succession is restricted to two, is too narrow. The expression "any         Magistrate" at the beginning of s.142 (1) of the MCA did  not  mean         only one Magistrate but many Magistrates. Any number of Magistrates         could hear and record the whole or any part of evidence in a  trial         ending with one who gives judgment where  applicable.  The  section         provided a safeguard against injustice  that  could  arise  from  a         trial conducted by a succession of Magistrates in that the  proviso         permits a magistrate to hear the case de novo. Decision in Eustance         v Rep (supra) overruled.     ii) The Court of Appeal misdirected itself in finding that the plea  of         guilty by the co-accused Okello led to a  reasonable  inference  of         guilt on the part of the  appellant.   Criminal  responsibility  is         personal to an individual even in the case of conspiracy.  However,         the misdirection did not cause a failure of justice as the Justices         of the Court  of  Appeal  were  satisfied  with  other  prosecution         evidence that proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt.    iii) The Appellant's bail was cancelled and  it  was  ordered  that  the         Appellant be taken into custody  to  resume  serving  his  term  of         imprisonment.
