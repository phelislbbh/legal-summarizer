                            THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA                     IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGANDA AT KAMPALA   HCT-00-CC-CS-1084 OF 2000  MONDAY P. ELIAB. ................................................ PLAINTIFF                                      VERSUS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ..............................DEFENDANT                        BEFORE: HON. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA                                    JUDGMENT:  The Plaintiff, Monday  P  Eliab  trading  as  Country-wide  Contractors  and Renovators, on 30th  August  2000  filed  this  suit  against  the  Attorney General claiming for the payment of Uganda  shs  174,220,000/=,  payment  Of UgShs 200,000/= per day from the date of filing this suit, return  of  motor vehicle Reg No. 860 UAJ, or payment of its market value, general damages  in conversion or detention of  goods  and  breach  of  contract,  interest  and costs.  The plaintiff in his pleadings claimed that on or about 7th March 1998 he entered into a motor vehicle hire agreement with State House wherein his motor vehicle Reg. No. 860 UAJ, Land Cruiser, (hereafter referred to as "the vehicle") was hired by State House as a service vehicle for the Presidential convoy at hiring charge of shs 200,000/= per day from 7th March 1998.  Up to the date of filing the suit State House was still hiring and using the vehicle.  By 31st March, 1998 State House had defaulted in payment in the total sum of shs5, 600,000/=.  On 15th June 2000 the plaintiff was paid shs5, 580,000/= thereby reducing the indebtedness to plaintiff to a sum of Shs 20,000/= as of 31 March 1998.  The plaintiff therefore claims that balance of shs20,000 for the period up to 31st March 1998 and for the period from  1st April 1998 at the rate shs 200,000/= per day till judgment or return of the vehicle. He also prays for the other claims stated above.  The Attorney General, in his Amended Written Statement of Defence filed on 30th June 2004 contends that the plaintiff entered into a vehicle hire agreement with State House from the 18th March 1998 up to 31st March 1998. Denies causing the plaintiff the claimed losses and damages and contends that the plaintiff was never denied recovery of the vehicle.  That State House did not continue to hold the vehicle after the accident.  At the scheduling conference, conducted before my predecessor in this matter, the following facts were recorded as agreed:  There was an agreement of hire of the plaintiff's motor vehicle to the defendant at an agreed price of shs 200,000/= per day.  The agreement being effective from 7th March 1998. There was an accident involving the motor vehicle on 31st March 1998. There was some payment of shs5, 580,000/= made to the plaintiff in June 2000 in respect of the hire of the vehicle.  The following issues were agreed for court's determination:-  Whether the contract subsisted beyond 31st March 1998? Whether the defendant owed the plaintiff any money in respect         of the hire agreement? Whether the defendant retained the custody of the vehicle in         question. The available remedies.  I will handle the issues in this order - 1st, 3rd, 2nd, and 4th issue.  1st Issue whether the contract subsisted beyond 31st March 1998.  The plaintiff testified that on 7th March 1998, he entered into a hire agreement with State House.  The agreement was in the form of a Local Purchase Order (LPO) received in evidence as exhibit P1.  The LPO was signed on behalf of State House by the Ag. Transport Officer, one Moses Kyaruzi.  He testified  further that the agreement was on self-drive basis, commencing on 7th March 1998 and open ended at a daily rental charge  of shs200,000/=.  On 3rd April 1998 he was informed by his cousin, one Paddy Baguma, that his vehicle was at Masaka Police Station following an accident.  The Plaintiff saw the vehicle at the Police Station.  The plaintiff complained that the accident occurred on 31st March 1998 but State House did not inform him of the accident.  It was only sometime later that he received a letter from State House signed by Ms Katunguka. According to him the accident did not terminate the hire contract.  Up to the date of his testimony the vehicle had not been delivered back to him by State House.  He stated that State House had paid him for the month of March 1998 a sum of Shs 5,356,000/= by cheque dated 17th June 2000.  He therefore demanded rental for the period from 1st April 1998 up to the time of judgment at the rate of Shs200, 000/= per day  The defendant adduced the evidence of three witnesses.  DW1, Mwogyere Mathodius, testified that between 1995 and 1998 he worked with State House as an Administrative Officer. His duties included organizing the President's travel within and outside Uganda. When there was no sufficient State House fleet vehicles they would obtain vehicles from outside.  He stated that State House had hired the plaintiff's vehicle from 18th March 1998 to 31st March 1998.  He testified that the engagement was upon an LPO which he tendered in evidence and received as exhibit D9.  The LPO was authorized and signed by the witness.  Exhibit D9 shows that the agreement was on self drive basis, date of travel was indicated as 18th March 1998 and the expected date of return indicated therein as 31st March 1998.  The witness testified that after signing the LPO the vehicle was handed over to the convoy foreman, one Sgt Lubega.  That on the convoy's return leg the vehicle was involved in an accident.  According to the witness the hire agreement stopped on 31st March 1998. In his testimony DW2, Lubega Joseph, stated that he is a soldier at the rank of sergeant, attached to State House as driver and chief mechanic.  He was the driver of the vehicle at the material time.  That while on their way back from Ntungamo, as they approached Masaka, driving about 200 meters behind the Presidential convoy, the vehicle was knocked by a trailer and it over-turned.  The accident was around 7:30 p.m. The accident was reported to Masaka Police Station and the damaged vehicle was towed to the Police Station.  The witness further testified that the following morning, at around 7:30 a.m., he rang the plaintiff and informed him of the accident.  That morning the plaintiff found the witness at State House and he handed the plaintiff the Log Sheet Book, which he said the sheets therein looked like exhibit D6. That he advised the plaintiff to go to Masaka Police Station, where he had already named the plaintiff as the owner of the vehicle.  Both DW1 and DW2 did not know what happened to the vehicle thereafter.  DW3 Paul Kaggwa in his testimony claimed that he was the owner of the vehicle. When he learned of the accident he went to Masaka Police Station armed with the Logbook of the vehicle claimed the vehicle and it was released to him on 14th March 2000.  At the time of his testimony he still had the vehicle in his possession.  As to whether the hire agreement extended beyond 31st March 1998 Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the LPO, exhibit P1, was the valid hire agreement   and it was open ended.  Counsel pointed out that in his testimony DW1 had stated that it was the practice of State House in hiring vehicles that if they were uncertain as to how long the vehicle would be required, the contract of hire would be open ended.  Exhibit P1 did not indicate the date of travel nor the expected date of return.  It indicated the date of authorization by the Chief Transport Officer, named therein as Kyaruzi Moses, as 7th March 1998.  Counsel also referred to exhibit D1, a letter dated 29th August 2000 written by T. Kiwalwa, the State House Controller/ Permanent Secretary, which he argued confirmed the fact that the vehicle was hired by State House on 7th March 1998 and that no contract had ever been signed for hire of the said vehicle since that time.  In that letter the State House Controller wrote:-      "It is true that the said vehicle was hired by State House on  the  7th     March, 1998.  However, it worked for a short period and stopped because     it was involved in an accident and  could  not  continue  working.   No     other contract has ever been signed for hire of the said vehicle  since     that time. --." Counsel further argued that the LPO exhibit D9 was an after  thought  and  a creation of the defendant in an attempt  to  prove  that  the  contract  was terminated on the 31st March 1998 and defeat the plaintiff's claim.  On the other hand Counsel for the defendant submitted that the contract did not subsist beyond 31st March 1998.  He relied on the evidence of DW1, Methodious Mwagyere who acknowledged exhibit D9 as the contract between the plaintiff and State House.  The LPO shows the date of travel as 18th March 1998 and the expected date of return as 31st March 1998.  The witness stated that in most cases the duration of the contract would be stated and where it was not done the officer in charge would sign on the Log Sheet after each day of service.  During cross-examination the witness stated:      "In rare cases where the duration was certain the starting  date  would     be indicated.  In most cases and at the end of the specific  assignment     the person who is using the hired vehicle  would  sign  the  log  sheet     indicating the days the vehicle has been under his use and it would  be     for only those days that the owner would invoice for.   The  LPO  would     have the starting date but not the closing date in  rare  circumstance.     In those circumstances the closing date would only appear  on  the  log     sheet and signed by the using officer."   The witness identified exhibit D4 as one of  the  invoices  which  they  had received.  Exhibit D4 is a set of documents which include a  letter  by  the plaintiff to the financial controller State House. The letter is  dated  9th April 1998.  This was after the accident, stated therein  to  have  occurred on 31st March 1998.  It is  "Re: Request for the amount due  in  respect  of M/V 960 UAJ Land Cruiser for March  1998"  Attached  to  it  is  a  proforma Invoice also dated  9th April 1998.  The particulars indicated are:      "Being fees for Rental services of the said M/V used by  the  Mechanics     'Vide' attached Rental Confirmation Note OD 9th April 98  for  28  days     from 4th March 1998 to 31st March 1998."   Number  of  days  was  given  as28  days  at  shs200,  000/=  totaling   shs 5,600,000/=.  Verification by State House  was  17  days  at  shs150,  000/= totaling Shs2, 550,000 and 11 days at  200,000/=  totaling  shs2,  200,000/= making a grand total of  Shs4,  750,000/=  verified.   Also  attached  is  a Rental Confirmation Note.   For  the  period  relevant  for  the  two  LPOs, exhibits P1 and D9, it shows that the vehicle was  confirmed  used  for  the period from 18th February 1998 to 28th February 1998 on a daily  basis.   It continued to be used on a daily basis from 1st  March  1998  to  17th  March 1998.  Thereafter there is  not  evidence  of  confirmation  of  use.   Also attached was a proforma/ invoice No. 014 dated 9th March 1998 in respect  of the Rental Confirmation Note dated  2nd  March  1998.   Annexed  is  also  a General Purposes Form Voucher No RD 570 dated 2nd June 2000 drawn in  favour of the plaintiff's company in the total sum  of  Shs5,356,800/= payment  for use of the  vehicle during the month of March 1998 as per  Invoice  Nos  020 and 014.  While being cross-examined the plaintiff admitted that prior to the 7th March 1998 engagement, he had dealt with State House before for three weeks.  The letter and its attachments, exhibit D4, was received in evidence by Consent of both parties at the scheduling conference.  In his testimony the plaintiff did not vary anything in it.  While considering the Civil Procedure Rules with regard to a Scheduling Conference in Administrator General Vs Bwanika James and others S.C.C. A. No 7 of 2003. Tsekoko JSC stated:      "I would like to say something on the  essence  of  the  holding  of  a     Scheduling Conference before trial in Civil Suits and  the  consequence     of agreements or disagreements reached on certain matters by parties at     such scheduling conference."      His Lordships then went on to state:       "As I understand these provisions their purpose is to enable parties to     agree on non - contentious evidence such as facts and  documents.   The     agreed facts and documents thereafter become part of  the  evidence  on     record so that they are evaluated along with the rest of  the  evidence     before judgment is given.   Indeed in as much as they are admitted without contest, the contents of such admitted documents can be treated as true, unless those contents intrinsically  point to the contrary, and if they are relevant to any issue, their admission disposes of that issue because  the need for proof or disproof would have been disposed of by the fact of admission."  An evaluation of the plaintiff's evidence together with exhibit D4  and  the evidence  of DW1 show that prior to 7th March 1998 the  plaintiff's  vehicle was  hired  by  State  House  on  a  daily  basis.   Save  for  the   Rental Confirmation Notes, part of exhibit D4, there are  no  LPO  for  the  period from 4th February 1998 to 6th March 1998.  However, exhibit  D4  shows  that the plaintiff billed State House and State House approved payment  for  that period.  The LPO, exhibit P1 was approved on 7th March  1998  but  does  not show when the vehicle was to travel and when it was  expected  to  returned. However, exhibit D4 show that the vehicle continued to be used  on  a  daily basis from 7th March 1998 to 17th March 1998.   The  LPO,  exhibit  P1,  was open ended.  There is no other LPO between 7th  March  1998  to  17th  March 1998. Exhibition D4 also shows that the plaintiff  billed  State  House  and State House approved payment for that period.  It is an agreed fact that State House continued to hire the plaintiff's vehicle from 18th March 1998.  The issue is whether the hire thereafter was vide the LPO exhibit P1 or LPO exhibit D9.  If the valid contract was exhibit P1, the hire would be open ended.  But if the valid contract was exhibit D9 then the expected termination date of the agreement was 31st March 1998.  It is not disputed that the accident occurred on 31st March 1998 and it is not disputed that the Presidential convoy, including the vehicle, was at the material time on its way back.  The circumstances show that the vehicle was due to arrive in Kampala on the 31st March 1998, which was the expected return date indicated on the LPO exhibit D9 Though proforma/invoice 020 dated 9th April 1998 indicated that the claim was in respect of the Rental Confirmation Note of date 9th April 98 for 28 days from 4th March  1998 to 31st March 1998, which was the expected  return date indicated on the  LPO exhibit D9,  that Rental Confirmation Note run from 4th March 1998 to only 17th March 1998.  It therefore did not extend to the period between 18th March 1998 to 31st March 1998 which is the subject of the LPO exhibit D9.  The plaintiff did not explain why there was no Rental Confirmation Note for the 18th March 1998 to 31 March 1998 period.  In his testimony DW1 stated that where they were sure of the duration the LPO would indicate the period of hire.  He testified that with respect to the LPO exhibit D9 the vehicle was hired for the period from 18th March 1998 to 31st March 1998.  The witness further stated:-      "-In most cases we would indicate the duration.  In  cases  that  could     not be done at the end of the trip the owner of the vehicle would  sign     on the Log sheet to indicate the number of days it had  worked  and  it     would be countersigned by the officer who was using the vehicle.   This     would happen say where the President would extend his  period  of  stay     beyond the scheduled days."  The above testimony of DW1 explains the absence of Rental Confirmation  Note for the period from 18th March 1998 to 31st March 1998.  The hire was for  a specified period indicated on exhibit  D9.   Considering  all  the  evidence adduced by both parties I find that the plaintiff has failed to  prove  that the hire agreement was open ended.   The  defendant  has  on  a  balance  of probabilities proved that the hire  agreement  for  the  period  after  18th March 1998 was for a period up to 31st March  1998,.   It  did  not  subsist beyond 31st Mach 1998.   Issue No. 3 Whether the defendant retained the custody  of  the  vehicle  in question.  Unless extended,  under  the  LPO  exhibit  D9  the  vehicle  was expected to be returned to the plaintiff on  31st  March  1998.   It  is  an agreed fact that it was not returned  that  day.   It  got  involved  in  an accident while on its way to Kampala on 31st March 1998 at 7:30p.m.  At  the time of the accident and in the course of the  hire between 18th March  1998 to 31st  March 1998 it was being driven and under the control  of  DW2,  SGT Joseph Lubega. DW2 was a driver and Chief Mechanic attached to State House.   In his testimony DW2 stated that he was driving the  vehicle  on  a  private arrangement with the plaintiff  and  on  the  permission  of  his  boss  one Captain Agaba.  This is contrary to the testimony by  DW1  who  stated  that the vehicle was hired on self drive basis.   This  is  corroborated  by  the plaintiff, who also testified that the  vehicle    was  hired  out  on  self drive basis.  DW1 is indicated on Exhibit D9 as the  requisitioning  officer and designated  thereon  as  a  President  Protection  Unit  foreman.   This tallies well with DW2's statement that he was a Chief Mechanic and  sergeant attached to State House.  It is his statement that  following  the  accident he rang Mr. Mwagyere, the Senior Assistant Secretary, informed  him  of  the accident and  asked  him  to  get  them  a  vehicle.   Here,  he  was  again requisitioning a vehicle.  Therefore, he cannot be  believed  when  he  says that by his rank he had  no  mandate  to  requisition  for  a  vehicle.  The witness testified that he was  a  salaried  employee  of  the  State  House. Considering all the above I  cannot  accept  DW2's  testimony  that  he  was driving  the  vehicle  under  a  private  arrangement  with  the  plaintiff. Therefore, when the vehicle got involved in the accident, it was  under  the control and command of the staff of  State  House.   It  had  not  yet  been returned to the plaintiff as per the agreement on LPO exhibit D9.  It is the plaintiff's and defendant's evidence that following the accident the vehicle was taken to Masaka Police Station.  DW2 testified that as a result of the accident the vehicle got damaged, they rang Masaka Police Station and the vehicle was towed to the Station.  It is the testimony of DW3, Paul Kagwa, that the vehicle was released to him on 14th March 2000 by Masaka Police Station and it is still in his possession.  Exhibit D3 a letter dated 25th August 2001, by the District Police Commander, Masaka confirmed that the vehicle was involved in an accident on 31st March 1998, towed to CPS Masaka and later handed to Edward Kagwa.  The plaintiff testified that he inquired and discovered that Edward Kaggwa was Paul Kagwa's driver.   Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that State House had a duty to hand  the vehicle back to the plaintiff,  which  they  had  not  yet  done.   That  in failing to hand back the vehicle  to  the  plaintiff,  State  House  was  in breach of its duty as a bailee.  In his submission counsel for the defendant argued that the plaintiff was not entitled to custody of the vehicle.  The defendant's case is that the vehicle was released by the Police to Paul Kagwa the rightful owner and entitled to its custody.  Paul Kagwa testified that he had sold the vehicle to the plaintiff for Shs 5,000,000/= which was paid by cheque post dated to 10th February 1998 and he had retained the Log Book pending clearance/settlement of the cheque.  In his letter to the Solicitor General dated 10th November 2003, exhibit, D8, Paul Kagwa states:-       "On the 28th day of March  1998  motor  vehicle  number  860  UAJ  Land     Cruiser Toyota sale agreement was  entered  into  between  myself  Paul     Kaggwa (seller) and Mr. Monday Eliab  (the  purchaser)  for  a  sum  of     Ug.Shs 5,000,000/= (Five million shillings)  was  to   be  paid  on  or     about 6th June 1998.  A post dated  cheque  of  UgShs5,000,000/=  (five     million shillings)  drawn on Greenland   Bank  Account  number  125830,     cheque number  1812154 was  deposited  by  the  Purchaser  (Mr.  Monday     Eliab) to be presented on 5th June 1998 by the seller, the said  cheque     bounced.  Another one hereto attached number 0727176 also bounced.    On the 29th January 2000 when I realized that Mr. Monday Eliab was playing games I got my vehicle from Masaka Police Station and it is now in my possession as I am the registered owner."  The hire agreement run from 18th  to  31st  March  1998.   What  Paul  Kagwa states in the letter above contradicts  his  testimony  in  Court.   In  his evidence the witness stated:-      "I know Monday as a person who expressed interested in my vehicle  Land     Cruiser Reg. 860 UAJ.   In  January  1998  the  plaintiff  came  to  me     accompanied by one of my drivers in the Ministry called  Kagwa  and  he     said he wanted to buy my car.  My terms were that if he wanted the  car     he has to pay me.  We agreed at shs5, 000,000/-.  The plaintiff gave me     a post dated cheque of Greenland Bank of 10th February 1998.  I did not     give him the logbook.  This is the photocopy of the cheque."  The witness tendered the photocopy of the cheque received  as  exhibit  D10. He further testified  that  when  the  plaintiff  gave  him  the  cheque  he released the vehicle to him.  Therefore when the  plaintiff  hired  out  the vehicle to State House he was lawfully in  possession  of  the  vehicle  and entitled to its custody.   Whether  the  plaintiff  had  acquired  title  or ownership of the vehicle is not an issue for my decision in the suit  before me.  Further the said Paul  Kagwa  was  not  privy  to  the  hire  agreement between the plaintiff and State House.  The vehicle was under LPO exhibit D9 expected to be returned to the plaintiff on 31st March 1998.  It was that day instead delivered to Masaka Police Station by the staff of State House for safe custody.  DW1 stated in his evidence that whenever the vehicle would require servicing and repairs it would be referred back to the owner.  There no evidence to show that following the accident the vehicle was referred back to the plaintiff.  In his letter to the Financial Controller State House, dated 9th April 1998, Exhibit D4, the plaintiff laments that his vehicle  was towed to Masaka Police Station where it was still lying.  He therein request for assistance in towing the vehicle from Masaka.  There is no evidence that the assistance sought was given.  Instead the vehicle was delivered by Masaka Police Station, with whom State House had entrusted the vehicle, to Paul Kagwa who was not a party to the agreement.  In the circumstances I find that following the accident State House retained the custody of the plaintiff's vehicle.  Issue No. 2- Whether the defendant owed the plaintiff any money in respect of the hire agreement?  The hire agreement documented in exhibit D9 was for the period from 18th March 1998 to 31st March 1998 at an agreed daily rental of shs200,000/= . In resolving the first issue I have held that this hire agreement did not subsist beyond the 31st March 1998.  However, in resolving the third issue I have held that following the accident, which occurred on 31st March 1998, State House retained the custody of the vehicle.  In his submission Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the plaintiff is entitled to shs200, 000/= per day up to the time when the vehicle is returned to him.  In his submissions counsel for the defendant sought to rely on the defence of frustration.  Counsel relied on Krell Vs Henry (1903) All ER 20 where it was held by the Court of Appeal that:-      "Where a condition or state of things  clearly   appears  by  extrinsic     evidence to have been assumed by the parties to a contract  to  be  the     foundation  or  basis  of  the  contract  and  as  essential   to   its     performance, and an event which of  such   character   that  it  cannot     reasonably  be  supposed  to  have   been   in  contemplation  of   the     contracting parties when the  contract was made renders  it  impossible     to perform the  contract,  the  parties  are  discharged  from  further     performance of the contract."   Counsel also relied on Twentsche Overseas Trading  Co Ltd  Vs  Uganda  Sugar Factory  Ltd 12 EACA 1 where it was held that:-      "Frustration is a sort of shorthand.  It means that  the  contract  had     ceased to bind the parties because the common basis on which by  mutual     understanding it was based has failed.  It would be  more  ultimate  to     say, not that the contract has been frustrated, but that there has been     a failure of what in the contemplation of  both  parties  would  be  an     essential condition or purpose of the performance."   Frustration was not pleaded in the defendants Written Statement  of  defence and was not made an issue during trial.  I need not  consider  the  defence. However both Counsel in their  respective  submissions  addressed  it.   For that reason I will address the doctrine.  Counsel for the defendant argued that due to the accident, which was outside the contemplation of the parties and which strikes at the basis of the contract, the further performance was excused.  He further contends that the plaintiff was aware that the accident had occurred that the trailer was responsible for the accident and that all effort to trace the trailer by State House failed.  In the letter exhibit D4, the plaintiff stated:-      "On the 31st March, 1998 when the  said  M/  vehicle  was  coming  from     Ntungamo was knocked by the trailer  and  overturned.  Efforts  by  the     State House drivers to trace the trailer failed  as  it  was  dark  and     night.  --."   On his part, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that a  person  putting  up frustration as a defence should not be at fault  whatsoever  in  leading  to the said frustration.  That frustration should not arise out of his  act  or default.  Counsel quoted Viscount Maughan in Constantine Steamship Line  ltd Vs Imperial Smelting Corporation Ltd (1942) AC 154  where  at  page  171  he stated:     "Frustration, ---- is 'irrespective of the individuals concerned, their     temperaments and failings, their interest  and  circumstances.   It  is     really a device, by which  the  rules  as  to  absolute  contracts  are     reconciled with a special exception which justice demands. The purchase     'without  fault  on  either  side'  which  qualifies  the  doctrine  of     frustration is intelligible enough if it means that  a  party  who  has     disabled himself from performing his promise, or who has done something     to prevent the other party from performing his part  of  the  contract,     cannot set up a plea of frustration in a  case  of  which  his  act  or     default has rendered the performance of the  contract  impossible.   To     quote again from Lord Summer: 'I think it is now well settled that  the     principle of frustration of an adventure assumes that  the  frustration     arises without blame or fault  on  either  side.   Reliance  cannot  be     placed on a self induced frustration......"   Counsel argued that no evidence was adduced to show that much as  there  was an accident on the 31st March 1998, it was not  the  act  or  fault  of  the driver of State House that caused the accident.  In Gordon  Builders & Contractors Ltd Vs DAPCB HCCS No. 681/94 (1995) 11 KALR 14, relying on Howard & Co  (African) Ltd Vs Burton (1964) EA 540, Justice C. K. Byamugisha  stated:-       "Under our law, frustration of a contract arises if after its formation     certain sets of  circumstances  arise  which  owing  to  the  fault  of     neither party render the contract impossible -"   On burden of proof in Howard & Co (African) Ltd  Vs  Burton  (1964)  EA  540 Sir.  Daniel Crawshaw, JA at page 553 stated:      "The onus of proving frustration is on the party alleging  it,  and  if     that is proved the onus is upon the other party to prove  that  it  was     self-induced."  See also sections 102 and 103 of the Evidence Act.  In his testimony about the occurrence of the accident, DW2 stated:-     "I was driving about 200 meters behind the convoy when I was knocked by     a trailer and the vehicle overturned.  The vehicle got damaged."  Vehicles do not normally get knocked or overturn when driven with  due  care and attention.  Other than DW2's statement above  no  further  evidence  was adduced by the defendant to establish the cause of the accident.   What  the plaintiff wrote in his letter exhibit D4 cannot be  relied  on  as  evidence that the accident was caused by the trailer driver since he did not  witness the accident.  He must have been stating what he was informed.  Frustration was not specifically pleaded by the defendant and not framed as an issue for this courts determination.  Even if it had been, I find that the defendant has on a balance of probabilities failed to prove that there was frustration of the hire agreement by the occurrence of the accident.  The evidence adduced shows that the plaintiff was paid for the period up to 31st March 1998.  But he has never been paid for any period beyond that date, when State House continued to retain custody of the vehicle.  It is clear that the plaintiff was using the vehicle for hire and earning income.  Therefore, so long as the vehicle remained in State House's   possession the plaintiff was entitled to income. Therefore since the vehicle was not returned to the plaintiff the hire agreement was presumed to continue and was earning the plaintiff income.  I accordingly find that the defendant still owed the plaintiff in respect of the hire of his vehicle.  4th Issue - The available remedies:  The plaintiff prayed for judgment as follows: Shs.174, 220,000/- being contractual sum due to the plaintiff with effect from April 1998 to 30th August 2000 (30th August 2000 was the date of filing of this suit).   Shs200, 000/= per day with effect from 30th August 2000 up to  the  date  of judgment and / or return of the vehicle. General damages of Shs10,000,000/= Interest on the above at Bank of Uganda Commercial rate of 35% per annum from the date of filing suit till payment in full. Costs of the suit.  The hire agreement was due to terminate on 31st March 1998, when the vehicle should have been delivered back to the plaintiff.  On that very day the vehicle was involved in an accident making it impossible for the State House to deliver it back to the plaintiff.  The plaintiff contends that State House did not inform him of the accident and has since remained in custody of the vehicle.  He therefore demands payment of shs200, 000/= per day of continued possession of the vehicle by State House.  According to him to date State House is still in possession of the vehicle thereby earning him shs200, 000/= per day.  He therefore claims for Shs124, 220,000/= for the period from 1st April 1998 to 30th August 2000 when this suit was filed.  He also seeks a sum of shs200, 000/= per day from 1st September 2000 up to date of judgment.  In Henry Dhushime Vs S. M. Tours & Travel Ltd HCCS No. 231/91 (1998) II KALR  5 the defendant took the plaintiff's vehicle on hire for 8 days for a consideration of Shs80,000/= per day.  The defendant crushed the plaintiff's vehicle and did not return it to him till after more than two months.  The plaintiff contributed to the repair costs.  The plaintiff brought the suit to recover the unpaid monies as repair costs and hire costs and general damages and unearned income due to the time the vehicle spent in the garage.  Ntabgoba PJ awarded the plaintiff the repair costs incurred by the plaintiff.  He held that the defendant had breached the hire agreement due to failure to deliver back the plaintiff's vehicle at the expiration of the contract period of 8 days and there was no evidence of justify the failure by the defendant to surrender the vehicle to its owner.  His Lordship stated:-      "It cannot be argued that failure to deliver it was  due  to  the  fact     that it was in garage, pending repairs.  Plaintiff testified how he had     to search for his vehicle only to be told that the defendant had dumped     it in a garage in Kisenyi where the defendant had not  taken  steps  to     have it repaired.  I hold that the  defendant  was  in  breach  of  the     agreement for which the plaintiff will be entitled to damages,  special     and general as hereafter to be indicated"  I find the above case on all fours with the instant case.  The Masaka District Police Commander in his letter dated 25th August 2001, exhibit D3 states:-      "The same motor vehicle was handed back to Mr. Kagwa Edward who claimed     it as the owner on 29th/1/2000 under reference TSD 26/29/1/2000."   DW3 stated that the vehicle was released to him by the Police on 14th  March 2000 following his claim for it as registered owner  thereof.   He  had  the logbook which named him  as  owner.   In  his  letter  the  District  Police Commander states that following the accident the vehicle was handed  in  the Police for safe custody.  There is no evidence to show that the  Police  had handed the vehicle to DW3 on  the  instructions  of  State  House.   In  its investigations the Police is expected to  act  independently.   Whether  the Police had acted lawfully when it released the vehicle to  DW2  is  not  the subject of my investigation in the case before me.  When the  Police  handed over the vehicle to DW3, that was an act of a third party outside the  scope of State House and State House thereafter lost control of  the  vehicle  and the ability to handover the vehicle to the plaintiff.  Up to 29th January 2000 the vehicle was still in Police custody on the instructions of State House.  Therefore State House was still in constructive custody of the vehicle.  The plaintiff was entitled to unearned income for all the period the vehicle remained in the custody of State House after 31st March 1998.  When the vehicle was released by the Police to DW3 it had stayed there for 19 months.  The vehicle had for all that period remained un utilised by the plaintiff.  The plaintiff and State House had fixed the daily rate at Shs 200,000/= which income the plaintiff had lost each day the vehicle remained undelivered back to him while in the custody of State House.  DW1 testified that the plaintiff was responsible for the vehicle repairs over the hire period whether due to accident or otherwise. The plaintiff denied this.  I am inclined to believe the plaintiff.  The LPO exhibit D9, which DW1 said was the basis of the hire agreement, indicates that the hire of the vehicle was approved by the authorizing officer, who was no other but the witness himself.  In view of the purpose for hire, which is indicated as vehicle for convoy mechanics, which was a Presidential convoy, to approve the vehicle for hire the witness must have satisfied himself about its mechanical condition.  The LPO is silent on the maintenance of the vehicle.  The presumption is that it had to be delivered back to the plaintiff in a sound mechanical condition as it had been handed over to the State House.  However, Counsel for the defendant in her submissions argued that the plaintiff is not entitled to the remedies prayed.  Alternatively she submitted that plaintiff should have mitigated his losses.  The issue is whether a party should be allowed to sit on his rights and be compensated in accumulated damages.  According to Mc Gergor on Damages paragraph 205 page 145 a plaintiff must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him consequent upon the defendant's wrong and cannot recover damages of any such loss which he could thus have avoided but has failed, through unreasonable action or inaction to avoid.  The accident occurred on 31st March 1998.  The plaintiff claims that he was not notified of accident.  However DW2, who was in charge of the vehicle, testified that following the accident he rang and informed the plaintiff. The plaintiff came and found the witness at the State House the following morning and the witness handed him the Log Sheet Book.  State House paid for the period up to 31st March 1998 but did not exhibit Rental Conformation Notes for the period from 17th March 1998.  This put DW2's testimony in doubt whether he actually met the plaintiff following the accident because he should have signed on the Rental Confirmation Note for that period and the same would have been available.  This corroborates the plaintiff's testimony that he was not officially notified of the accident.   However, it is the testimony of the plaintiff that on 3rd April, 1998 his cousin one Paddy Baguma informed him of the accident.  On 4th April 1998 the plaintiff saw the vehicle at Masaka Police Station.  He stated that the police refused to handover the vehicle to him for the reasons that they were still carrying out investigations about the accident.  On 9th April 1998 by letter exhibit D4 the plaintiff wrote to the Financial Controller State House seeking for assistance to tow the vehicle from Masaka Police Station.  The above evidence shows that on 4th April 1998 the plaintiff became aware of the state of the vehicle following the accident and was convinced that it could only be removed from Masaka Police Station by only being towed.  He was therefore aware of the extent of the damage and aware that in that state in could not carry on with the objective of the hire agreement.  It is the plaintiff's testimony and that of DW1 that the assistance sought vide exhibit D4 was not given.  The plaintiff, who was so aware of the vehicles damage and with no assistance from State House, does not give evidence of any other steps taken to mitigate the loss he was suffering. The vehicle remained at the Police Station until 14th March 2000 when it was collected from there by Paul Kagwa.  By then the vehicle had been lying at the Police Station for 23 1/2 months.  This is a hire contract which was to expire on 31st March 1998 but presumed extended beyond the agreed date by continued custody of the vehicle by State House.  Due to the state of the vehicle, which the plaintiff was aware of from 4th April 1998 it is clear that State House did not continue utilizing the vehicle.  Evidence adduced shows that the plaintiff clearly appreciated this fact. He lodged with State House invoice No 20 date 9th April 1998 for payment of the rental fees for the period ending 31st March 1998.  Payment was not made until June 2000.  There is no evidence to show that the plaintiff had lodged with State House any other invoice seeking payment for the period beyond 31st March 1998.  Also the plaintiff's claim for payment through his lawyer by the letter dated 17th May 2000, exhibit D5, and does not go beyond March 1998.  In Dhushine Vs S. M. Tours & Travel Ltd (above) Ntabgoba PJ awarded plaintiff Shs5, 360,000/= as loss of earning at the agreed hire rate of Shs80, 000/= per day for the 65 days the vehicle remained in the garage. His  Lordship, however, "discounted the award by 30% taking into consideration such facts as that his vehicle would not be on road every time and every day, that on some days it would be off the road on services, that the amount is now going to be paid in a lump sum, as well as many other imponderables."  Considering all the above the plaintiff is awarded Shs200, 000/= per day from 1st April to 29th January 2000, the date when the Police released the vehicle to Paul Kagwa.  That is 688 days at shs 200,000/= per day to make it Shs133, 600,000/=.  However, considering the fact that though aware of the state of the vehicle and where it was, the plaintiff did not take any steps to claim the vehicle from the Police Station.  Also aware that State House had on 31st 1998 breached the  agreement to deliver  back the vehicle and had thereafter not paid him,  the plaintiff sat on his rights for 2  years before   filing this suit.  Further the plaintiff had all along not lodged his claim with State House for payment for the period beyond 31st March 1998.  All the above aside, even if he had the vehicle, there would have been days when it would be off the road say for services or for some mechanical defects or luck of customers or other reasons. For the above reasons the award of lost income is discounted by 50%.  In the final result I award the plaintiff Shs 66,800,000/=  The plaintiff also prayed for general damages in the sum of Shs10, 000,000/=.  Counsel did not give any reasons why the plaintiff should be awarded general damages.  Since the issue of general damages has been left in doubt, what this court has to ask is what would have been in the contemplation of a reasonable man, when the contract was made, as the probable result of the breach of it.  In the instant case the plaintiff has been compensated for lost earnings. He must have suffered some inconveniences but he is also to blame for failure to mitigate the same. In the circumstances he is only awarded minimal damages in the sum of Shs2, 000,000/=  In the final result the plaintiff is awarded:- Shs66, 800,000/= being loss of income. Shs2, 000,000/= general damages. Interest on (a) and (b) above at 35% per annum from the date of judgment until payment in full. Costs of this suit                           Hon.
