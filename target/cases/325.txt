                          Escom Investment Limited
                                   Respondent


BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

   1. On 17th January 2006 I heard the above application for a temporary
      injunction and  dismissed the same with costs as it had no merit. I
      indicated that I would provide my reasons for doing so on 31st January
      2007 and I now do so.
   2. In the head suit the applicant claims for a permanent injunction
      against the respondent on the ground that the respondent is
      interfering with its exclusive business of managing, collecting and
      disposal of solid waste in Kampala Central Division, as well as
      general damages for loss of income, inconvenience and costs of the
      suit. The applicant avers that it has an agreement with the Ministry
      of Local Government and Kampala City Council that confers upon it the
      exclusive right to manage solid disposal in Kampala Central Division,
      to run for 3 years from 1st January 2005.
   3. The application sought a temporary injunction to issue against the
      respondent, its employees, agents, or any body acting on its
      instructions from interfering in any way whatsoever with the
      applicant's business of solid waste management and disposal in Kampala
      Central Division. The grounds of the application set forth in the
      application are two. Firstly that the applicant is the exclusive
      manager and disposer of solid waste in Kampala Central Division.
      Secondly that the respondent's interference in the applicant's
      business will occasion loss which the respondent is incapable of
      compensating. It asserted that further and other grounds would be
      found in the affidavit of Sonko Abdul, the applicant's project
      director. The application is brought under Order 41 Rules 2 and 9 of
      the Civil Procedure Rules and Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Act.
   4. The respondent opposed this application and filed an affidavit in
      reply.
   5. At the hearing of the application I asked Mr. Mike Musisi, learned
      counsel for the applicant to point to the evidence that indicated that
      the applicant would suffer irreparable loss if the temporary
      injunction was not granted. Mr. Musisi replied that the respondents
      did not have an agreement with Kampala City Council. Nor had they
      followed the proper procedure of tendering to obtain such contract as
      the applicants had done. The applicant is no longer able to collect
      any fees from its clients. The applicant had entered into a contract
      with a foreign firm to recycle and utilize garbage for development.
      The applicant has purchased vehicles for refuse collection. The
      additional affidavit of Mr. Juma Mugisha shows the nature of
      interference. The respondent's employees have assaulted the employees
      of the applicant several times in the city.
   6. Mr. Musisi further submitted that the acts complained of had not been
      denied by the respondent, and in any case the respondents affidavit
      was incurably defective as it did not disclose whether the deponent is
      swearing is matters to his own knowledge or belief. He referred to the
      case of Kagwimukya v Kasigwa [1978] HCB 251 in support therof.
   7. Mr. Byenkya, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that this
      application failed to establish a prima facie case as the person sued
      is not privy to the contracts relied upon. Secondly that if this is a
      question of interference with a contract, the applicants had failed to
      show even a single customer who had been interfered with. There is no
      basis for finding that there has been interference with a contract.
      Thirdly he submitted that the applicants had failed to establish that
      they would suffer irreparable loss.
   8. The law with regard to temporary injunctions, like the one applied
      for, is well settled. In respect of applications sought under Order 41
      Rule 2 of the Civil Procedure Rules, the main suit must be seeking an
      injunction against the defendant. The suit ought to have a probability
      of success, or at least disclose serious questions for investigation.
      The injury alleged to be suffered by the applicant must be
      irreparable. This would mean that an award of damages would not be
      adequate compensation for the same. In case of doubt with regard to
      the foregoing the court may then consider the balance of convenience.
      The purpose of the grant of the temporary injunction would be to
      preserve the status quo until the determination of the questions in
      issue.
   9. I examined both affidavits filed in support of the application. They
      allege a number of assaults by unnamed persons whom they assert to be
      employees of the respondent on employees of the applicants at
      different points and dates in Kampala. The affidavits allege that
      reports have been made to the police. There is no connection between
      the alleged assaults with the respondent. The affidavits allege that
      the respondents are collecting money from the applicant's customers.
      They do not name a single customer from whom the respondents have
      collected money. The allegations in both affidavits are of the most
      general nature.
  10. The applicant failed to establish that it was likely to suffer any
      irreparable harm, which is loss that money could not atone for. If the
      complaint is that the applicant has been prevented from collecting
      fees for refuse collection, that in my view is not sufficient, to show
      that the loss resulting from such a situation is irreparable. If the
      loss is only fees not collected, such loss can be atoned for by way of
      monetary damages.
  11. Applicant's counsel mentioned a joint venture with a foreign company,
      which was just starting. Mr. Ssonko's affidavit asserts that this
      project is likely to be disrupted and thus cause damage that cannot be
      atoned for by an award of monetary damages. The affidavit does not
      show what damage is likely to flow from the alleged disruption, let
      alone the nature of the disruption itself, to the project. It is
      simply a bare assertion without more. Nothing is provided upon which
      this court can weigh whether or not the alleged damage likely to be
      suffered, or already suffered, is irreparable.
  12. It was suggested in the affidavit of Mr. Ssonko, that the respondent
      was a new company with a small share capital and fluctuating
      membership, incapable of compensating the applicant. This is a
      consideration that ought not to be taken into account in determining
      whether the damage alleged to be suffered cannot be atoned for by way
      of monetary damages. This consideration speaks, not to the nature of
      damages in question, but to the ability of the respondent to meet the
      same, an aspect that can be addressed differently.
  13. The applicant claims it has the exclusive right, arising out of
      contract with Kampala City Council and the Ministry of Local
      Government, to manage solid waste disposal in Kampala Central
      Division. The applicant does not cite any particular provision that
      purports to grant this right. I examined the documents annexed to the
      affidavit of Mr. Ssonko, in support of the application. I have not
      come across any provision to support that claim. To the contrary, the
      contract documents do recognise that the some city residents had made
      private arrangements with individual contractors to collect refuse.
      The contract documents do not purport to affect such contracts as far
      as I can gather.
  14.  The contract does set out certain deliverables that the applicant had
      to perform and do so within certain timelines. The application is
      silent on how the respondent's alleged interference has impacted on
      these deliverables or duties of the applicant, save for the bare
      assertion of being unable to collect fees from unnamed city dwellers.
  15. I was satisfied that on a careful evaluation of the application and
      its supporting affidavits alone, no case had been made out for the
      issue of a temporary injunction. I therefore decided to dismiss it
      with costs.
Signed, dated and delivered at Kampala this 31st day of January 2007-01-30
