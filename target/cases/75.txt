BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

JUDGMENT

The plaintiff had loan accounts with the Uganda Commercial Bank. The
balance of one such account, being Shs.49,383,580.00 as at 31/12/1995, was
assigned to the defendant, a statutory body, established under the Non-
Performing Assets Recovery Act, Chapter 95, Laws of Uganda 2000 Rev. Ed.,
on the 7/03/1996. This assignment was in writing. The loan originally
granted to the plaintiff in respect of this matter arises was used for the
purchase of certain goods, some of which, were eventually retained by
Uganda Commercial Bank, and were never released to the plaintiff.
The plaintiff after the assignment referred to above entered into an
arrangement with the defendant whereby it paid to the defendant the
assigned sum together with interest, less certain sums waived off,
totalling to Shs.146,490,444.00. The plaintiff now brings this action
seeking to recover from the defendant the said sums plus other sums on the
ground that the defendant falsely represented to the plaintiff that the sum
assigned was shs.146,496,444.00, whereas not. It is contended that demand
for shs.146,496,444.00 was a false representation in so far as the
defendant, as assignee, did not have power and or authority to demand and
receive any more than Shs.49,383,580.00 that was assigned to it.
The plaintiff further claimed special and general damages, particulars
whereof, were set out in the plaint, arising from the detention and non-
release to date, by Uganda Commercial Bank of the goods, to wit spares,
that the plaintiff had imported using the funds obtained from Uganda
Commercial Bank. The plaintiff further claimed interest on all the sums
claimed, an order for delivery of spares, and costs of the suit.
The defendant denied the plaintiff's claim and contended that the plaintiff
had collected most of the spares that it had imported and what had
remained, was eventually valued and the value thereof was included in the
discount/waiver of shs.42,000,000.00 credited to the plaintiff's account
with the defendant.
At scheduling stage of the proceedings the parties agreed to the following
facts. That the plaintiff was given loans by Uganda Commercial Bank. It
defaulted in repaying the loans. That the current account kept by the
plaintiff with UCB relative to the loans was No.10-0015 which had 2 loan
accounts no. BFL 4026 and 3030. That account number 10-0015 was assigned to
the defendant by deed of assignment dated 7th March 1996. The amount
assigned was shs.49,383,500.00 as at 31st December 1995. Included in the
assignment were securities  LRV 1384/4 and LRV 1359/23 and a debenture
dated 17th August 1988. That the plaintiff paid off the assigned debt to
NPART.
The parties agreed that all the documents annexed to the plaint be admitted
into evidence without proof and marked as exhibits in the order that they
were annexed. Similar agreement was reached with regard to the documents
annexed to the  amended written statement of defence. This was done
accordingly.
The parties agreed that in light of the admitted facts and documents there
were only three issues to be determined by this court. Firstly, how much
money did the plaintiff pay to the defendant? Secondly, if this amount is
higher than the sum assigned, whether the defendant was entitled to receive
more amounts than was assigned. Thirdly, if the defendant was not so
entitled, whether the plaintiff would be entitled to receive it back with
interest.
The plaintiff chose not to call any further evidence, in light of the
documents accepted in evidence, and therefore did not call any witnesses.
The defendant called 3 witnesses. These were, DW1, Mr. Apollo Obo from the
Bank of Uganda, DW2 Mr. Francis Onebe from Ernest & Young and DW3 Mr.
Herbert Kwikiriza from NPART.
The relevant facts of this case, as can be gathered from the agreed facts,
the documentary evidence admitted in evidence, and the testimony of the
defendant's witnesses, are essentially not in dispute. The plaintiff had
loans with the defunct Uganda Commercial Bank which had become non-
performing assets in the portfolio of Uganda Commercial Bank.
On the 7th March 1996 Uganda Commercial Bank assigned by deed of assignment
to the defendant 'loan bal.Shs.49,383,580 as at 31st December 1995 A/C 10-
0015.' The defendant approached the plaintiff and got them to sign a
repayment proposal which the plaintiffs signed on 6th May 1996, admitted in
evidence as Exhibit 28. This repayment proposal sets out the outstanding
amounts as on 30.09.94 to be Shs.81,383,580.00 and the particulars thereof
are stated to be 'balance confirmed by E & Y'.  The next entry is for the
same date, and is a debit entry for 'interest updated Jan-Sept 94 for
Shs.65,106,864.00.' This brought the total debit balance to
Shs.146,490,444.00. The rest of the entries are credit entries showing the
monthly payments that the plaintiff was to make to the defendants until the
debit balance was 0.
The plaintiff did not keep to this schedule but finally the whole amount
was paid off save for the discount or waiver of Shs.42,492,356.00 and this
is shown in Exhibit D20.
It is now the plaintiff's case that defendant was not entitled to demand
more than the sum assigned, Shs. 49,383,580.00, and any payment in excess
thereof was made under mistake, and the defendant ought to pay back the
same to the plaintiff with interest. On the other hand the defendant
asserts that it was entitled to recover the loan amount inclusive of
outstanding interest, which is what they did. Both parties' counsel filed
written submissions.
In the written submissions of learned counsel for the plaintiff, Mr. Nestor
Byamugisha, the defendant was only entitled to the sum assigned, and in
case the defendant had to claim any other sum from the plaintiff, other
than the sum assigned, there had to be a fresh new assignment for such new
sums of money, which is not the case at hand. He referred to the decisions
of the NPART Tribunal in support of his arguments. These are NPART v West
Nile Distilling Co. Ltd, tribunal case no. 28 of 1996 and Paul J Erongot v
NPART tribunal case no. 17 of 1996, all unreported. He submitted that the
plaintiff had paid the defendant a total of shs.183,129,317.00 when only
Shs.43,210,065.00 (sum assigned less the automatic discount of 12.5%)
should have been demanded of the plaintiff. The difference, being
shs.139,919,232/=, was not due to the defendant and was paid under mistake.
This court should order the defendant to pay it back to the plaintiff with
interest at the rate of 30%.
In the written submissions of learned counsel for the defendant, Dr.
Byamugisha, it is contended that the sum assigned had an element of
interest which had been suspended but was recoverable. He relies on the
deed of assignment and the annextures to the same, which he contends were
assigned to the defendant, and not just the sum of Shs.49,383,580.00 only.
Dr. Byamugisha further contends that according to the testimony of DW1, Mr.
Obbo, an employee with the Bank of Uganda, recovery of a nonperforming
asset could involve recovery of all accrued interest up to the time of
recovery.
Dr. Byamugisha further submitted that according to the testimony of DW2,
the amount due had been carefully worked out by Ernest & Young in 1994 who
issued their report a year later, presumably in 1995, which arrived at the
principal sum and interest that the defendant recovered from the plaintiff,
as it was entitled to do.
The plaintiff relies on two cases decided by the NPART Tribunal. The first
one is Non-Performing Assets Recovery Trust v West Nile Distilling Co. Ltd,
Tribunal Case No. 28 of 1996. In that case there was dispute as to what
amount was recoverable. Was it to be the sum assigned or a larger amount
inclusive of interest?
The Tribunal answered the question in the following words,
           'We note that on 5th September, 1995, UCB by deed of assignment
           assigned to the Plaintiff only Shs.130,388,305/=, which the
           deed, now annexture "F" to the plaint, described as - "Loan Bal.
           Shs.130,388,305/= as at 30th September, 1995 A/C 10000479." This
           was done in virtue of s.11(1) of Statute 11 of 1994. Section
           11(2) of the statute reads as follows,
                                          "11(2) All assets, rights,
           liabilities and obligations attached to a non-performing asset
           transferred by the bank to the Trust under this Section, which
           immediately before the date of transfer were held by or
           subsisted against the bank shall subject to any directions given
           by the Minister in writing, vest in or as the case may be,
           subsist against the Trust."      We have no evidence that the
           Minister has given any directions in this case. Unless there
           exists in the Statute an express provision or a provision by
           necessary implication, conferring power to NPART to charge
           interest on a non-performing asset upon assignment by UCB, NPART
           cannot confer upon itself the powers UCB could not exercise at
           the date of assignment and which were neither conferred by the
           assignment deed nor by statute.
                            In the case of Paul J. Erongot vs. NPART
           Tribunal Case No. 17 of 1996, we considered a similar situation
           and held that NPART (also Plaintiff then) could only recover by
           action the amount assigned to it by the deed of assignment. We
           have not been persuaded that that decision was wrong. We propose
           to adopt the same reasoning. We accordingly hold that the
           plaintiff in this case can only recover  shs.130,388,305.00
           which was assigned to it by deed.'
In the case of Paul J Erongot v NPART Tribunal Case No.17 of 1996, the
plaintiff Paul Erongot was a member of staff of Uganda Commercial Bank. He
obtained a loan from the Uganda Commercial Bank to build a home. Over the
course of time the parties varied the agreement, waiving off some
accumulated interest. At the time of assignment the loan amount was
Shs.229, 035,554.00. When NPART took over the loan, it sought to disregard
the interest waived, and claimed Shs289,299.296.00, ignoring the
rescheduled payment schedule and amount agreed to between the Plaintiff and
Uganda Commercial Bank.
The tribunal dealt with the matter in this manner.
           'The second leg of the issue is how much is due and recoverable.
           As earlier noted, Mr. Byenkya contends that only the assigned
           amount is recoverable. On the other side Mr. Walubiri contends
           that the amount  is more than that, i.e. Shs.289,299, 296/-.
           This is the figure which was worked out by Ernest and Young and
           adopted by D.W.3 and in effect this amount incorporates the
           interest in arrears which UCB had waived. With some adjustments,
           this figure is in exh.D2 produced by DW3. .....................
                        It appears to us that by operation of S.11(2) the
           defendant took over all rights, liabilities, and obligations
           attached to the loan of the plaintiff. Notwithstanding our
           findings on issue No.1, we think that, as there was a binding
           contract between the plaintiff and UCB in respect of the amount
           outstanding at the time of assignment on 26/2/1996, the
           defendant inherited the obligations under that agreement. The
           result is that the defendant can only recover the amount
           assigned to it, i.e. shs.229,035,554/-. That answers the second
           leg of the second issue.'
It appears to me that the Tribunal in the Erongot v NPART (supra) held that
the NPART was bound by the agreement between Uganda Commercial Bank and the
plaintiff which in effect waived off some interest due on the loan of the
Plaintiff to Uganda Commercial Bank, and NPART could not therefore ignore
it, and claim that interest waived off. I entirely agree with the reasoning
of the Tribunal in Erongot v NPART (supra).
This is somewhat different from the holding in Non-Performing Assets
Recovery Trust v West Nile Distilling Co. Ltd (supra) that NPART could not
recover more money than was stated in the assignment deed. In particular
that NPART could not recover interest at all, unless expressly or by
necessary implication authorised by Statute, as UCB itself had no such
power. What gives me some disquiet is that the Tribunal adopted the
reasoning in Erongot v NPART, which was dealing with somewhat different
facts from those presented to the tribunal in Non-Performing Assets
Recovery Trust v West Nile Distilling Co. Ltd (supra).
It would appear to me that Section 9(2) of the Nonperforming Assets
Recovery Statute Act, (referred to as S.11 (2) by the Tribunal and set out
in full), preserved the existing assets, rights, liabilities, and
obligations attached to the nonperforming asset, to continue, after the
assignment, to vest in or subsist against the Trust. For instance if the
nonperforming asset, in case it was a loan, it could still carry interest,
if interest had originally attached to the loan, and unless such interest
had been waived expressly by UCB or both parties, as was the case in
Erongot v NPART, such interest would continue to attach to the loan, or
nonperforming asset, from the date expressed in such assignment to be the
date at which the loan balance assigned was outstanding.
The Minister had the power to give directions in writing with respect to
such rights, obligations, liabilities or interests and where he/she had not
exercised such power, the status quo in law, and by subsisting agreement
would remain. In Non-Performing Assets Recovery Trust v West Nile
Distilling Co. Ltd (supra) it is not clear from the judgment how UCB had
lost the power to charge interest. In my humble view, once a nonperforming
asset was assigned to NPART, NPART could do what UCB could do with effect
from the date of assignment or, as in this particular case, the date
expressed 'as at 31st December 1995'  which is the date up to which the
amount assigned had been ostensibly or otherwise calculated. NPART was not
entitled to go back, beyond the date of assignment, or the date expressed
as 'as at.....' and the sum assigned. The date expressed in the deed as the
date at which X amount of money was outstanding, for the sum assigned, was
the cut off point, or if no such date was expressed in the deed of
assignment, the effective date of assignment would be the cut off point.
NPART could, in light of Section 9(2) of the statute, if it commenced an
action to recover the assigned amount, claim interest that was agreed
between UCB and the borrower with respect to the nonperforming asset for
the period between the date expressed in the deed of assignment and the
date of filing the action. Similarly it could agree with the parties on the
issue of interest on the assigned amount from the date expressed in the
deed of assignment till payment in full. In my view, there is no
prohibition against charging interest post the date expressed in the deed
of assignment. What NPART could not do is go behind the assigned sum, and
the date referred to therein, as its rights stem from the assignment,
including the sum assigned. To that extent I am, respectfully, unable to
arrive at the same conclusion as the tribunal did in Non-Performing Assets
Recovery Trust v West Nile Distilling Co. Ltd (supra), that NPART could not
charge interest.
I accept, in part, the submission of Dr. Byamugisha that NPART could charge
interest, but only post date expressed in the deed of assignment.
In the case before me, the asset assigned was Loan Bal. Shs.49,383,580.00
as at 31st December 1995. These words must be given their ordinary meaning.
As of the 31st December 1995, the loan outstanding was shs.49, 383,580.00.
This must be both the principal and interest as of that date. This is so
because the loan outstanding ordinarily and the banking practice must be
referring to both loan and interest. It is the balance outstanding as of
that date. Had there been any other sums outstanding, this should have been
indicated by qualifying that statement and figure assigned.
This loan balance was assigned on 7th March 1996. By this date Ernest &
Young had presumably reported to whoever they had to report to, and who had
to arrange for the assignment. Whether the report of Ernest & Young was
taken into consideration before the assignment was not an issue here, and
it was not necessary for it to be investigated here. That report could have
informed the parties before the assignment, and not after the assignment.
The sum assigned of Shs.49, 383,580.00 would have to be the starting
balance in the account that NPART would open for this plaintiff. It could
not be any other figure that was not assigned to it. The basis of any
authority for the defendant to recover from the plaintiff was the deed of
assignment, and not the report by Ernest & Young, if such report was not
acted upon in settling the figure or sum and date expressed in the deed of
assignment.
The plaintiff was not party to the assignment. It was between the defendant
and the Uganda Commercial Bank. These two parties had the benefit of all
their records, the reports of Ernest & Young, and whatever else they
needed. These two parties determined the asset to be assigned as 'loan
balance of Shs.49,383,580.00 as at 31st December 1995.' As of 31st December
1995 the loan balance due was Shs.49,383,580.00, and this was the only sum
assigned.
Dr. Byamugisha contends that what was assigned was not only the sum of
Shs.49,383,580.00 but also the annextures to the deed of the assignment.
Even if this argument was accepted, the annextures to the deed of
assignment did not set out any other sums of money which the defendant
would claim, beyond what was assigned. These annextures were the records
(one file and ledger cards), which were evidence of the loan, and
securities for the loan. The assignee had no right to attempt and derive a
different figure from the ledger cards, for instance, and then claim that
such amounts were the sums the defendant was entitled to by 31st December
1994, as the defendant purports to do in Exhibit P30 and Exhibit D20. The
sum assigned as at 31st December 1995 could only be shs.49,383,580.00 as
this is what the deed of assignment specified.
What the defendant claimed from the plaintiff was not this sum assigned but
something entirely different. The defendant claimed shs.146,490,444.00 as
of 30th September 1994. See Exhibit D19. In law and in fact there was no
basis for this claim. This sum was not assigned to the defendant. Any
claims of interest had to be on the assigned sum and from the date
expressed in the deed of assignment, and if no date was expressed, from the
date of the assignment. The opening balance against the plaintiff in the
defendant's books of accounts ought to have been Shs.49,383,580.00, the sum
assigned,  as at 31st December 1995, the date so specified in the deed of
assignment, and not Shs.81,383,580.00 plus Shs.65, 106,864.00, wherever and
whatsoever derived. In effect the defendant trashed the deed of assignment
and embarked on a voyage of their own, completely devoid of authority of
any kind.
The deed of assignment was executed on 7th March 1996. Five weeks later, as
indicated by Exhibit D19, the plaintiff had paid to the defendant a total
sum of Shs.54,898,088.00 made up of the Shs.32,000,000.00 as collections
thru UCB and Shs.22,898,089.00 being 20% deposit required by NPART. These
payments had liquidated the sums assigned with an excess that could have
taken care of a proper claim of interest for the period between 1st January
1996 to 30th April 1996.
In addition UCB was holding onto spares valued at Shs.24,232,541.00
belonging to the plaintiff which the defendant eventually credited to the
plaintiff and lumped it, in what it called a discount/waiver of
Shs.42,492,356.00, including a discount that was given to every debtor of
12.5%.
On a review of the account of the plaintiff in the defendants books, it is
clear that that the plaintiff paid Shs.128, 130,629.00 to the defendant
being the difference between the sum, claimed by the defendant from the
plaintiff, of Shs.146, 490,444.00 less Shs.18, 259,815.00, (the actual
discount being the difference between the value of the spares and the sum
credited to the plaintiff as discount/waiver, which was the discount on the
figure claimed.) To that sum of Shs.128,130,629.00, if you add the 12.5%
discount (on Shs.49,383,580.00, the sum assigned, which is
Shs.6,772,947.50), to which every person who paid 20% of the claim was
entitled to, you would get a figure of Shs.134,903,576.50 to the credit of
the plaintiff in the defendant's books. Against that amount in the debit
column would stand the sum assigned, shs.49,383,580.00, that leaves a
credit balance in favour of the plaintiff in the sum of Shs.85,519,996.50.
For the said sum of Shs.85, 519,996.50 to remain with the defendant would
be unjustified unjust enrichment to the detriment of the plaintiff who is
the person entitled to the said monies. To this sum must be added interest.
The defendant charged the plaintiff  interest on the loan at the rate of
30% per annum. This is clearly evident from Exhibit D1, the letter of offer
of the loan. It is just and equitable for the defendant to be charged the
same rate for the sums of money it extracted out of the plaintiff, without
justification whatsoever.
I would have been inclined to order interest on the above sum from the 24th
September 1996 when the plaintiff made the last payment directly to the
defendant, and by which date the defendant was in possession of all the
sums I have found to be due to the plaintiff though portions thereof had
got into the defendant's or UCB's possession earlier in the year, 1996, to
the date of this judgment. However, as counsel for the plaintiff has prayed
for interest effective from the 19th February 1999, I will order interest
at the rate of 30% per annum to be paid from 19th February 1999 till the
date of this judgment.
Accordingly I enter judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of
Shs.85,519,996.50 together with interest at the rate of 30% per annum from
24th September 1996 to the date of this judgement, and thereafter at court
rate till payment in full, and costs of this suit.
Signed, dated and delivered this 21st day of  February 2007
