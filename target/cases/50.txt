                              No. 269 of 2002]




JUDGEMENT OF THE COURT


Barasa Samuel, the appellant, was charged and convicted on his own  plea  of
guilt of defilement contrary to section 129 (1) of the Penal Code  Act.   He
was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment.

The following are the facts  leading  to  the  appeal.   On  29/3/2001,  the
victim and her brother were returning home from school  when  they  met  one
Awino Jennifer, the appellant's wife.  She persuaded the victim to  go  with
her to her home to help her with housework.  The victim  accepted  and  went
with Awino..  Awino told the victim to sleep with the appellant in the  same
house at night but she refused.   The  victim  and  Awino  shared  the  same
bedroom.  In the middle of the night the victim and Awino  went  outside  to
ease themselves.  The victim returned to  the  house  first  and  found  the
appellant in the bedroom.  The appellant  grabbed  the  victim  and  defiled
her.  The victim made  an  alarm  which  was  answered  by  the  appellant's
brother who kicked the door and rescued her.  The  matter  was  reported  to
the victim's parents who in turn reported to the  police.   The  victim  was
medically examined and found to be thirteen years old.  Her hymen  had  been
ruptured and there were injuries and  inflammation  on  her  private  parts.
The injuries were consistent with force having been used.   She also  had  a
bruise on her left knee.  The appellant was  also  medically  examined.   He
was found to be mentally normal and was aged 29 years.

When the case came up  for  trial  before  the  High  Court,  the  appellant
pleaded guilty to the charge of defilement.  He was convicted and  sentenced
to 8 years imprisonment.  He now appeals to this court with  leave,  against
the sentence on the following ground:

      "The sentence of  eight  years  passed  by  the  trial  judge  on  the
      appellant was harsh and excessive in the  circumstances  of  the  case
      considering that the appellant as a first offender who pleaded guilty,
      saving the court's time and expenses of a protracted trial."

Mr. Mark Bwengye, learned counsel for  the  appellant,  contended  that  the
sentence of 8 years imprisonment was  harsh  and  excessive.   He  submitted
that the appellant was remorseful, had a family to look after and  had  been
on remand for two years.  In passing sentence on the appellant  the  learned
trial judge did not take into account the fact that he had  been  on  remand
for two years.  He prayed this court to reduce the sentence  to  four  years
as the appellant had been on remand for two years.

Ms Alice Komuhangi, leaned  Senior  State  Attorney,  did  not  agree.   She
supported the sentence of 8 years that was imposed by the trial court.   She
argued that the sentence was neither harsh  nor  excessive.   She  submitted
that the learned trial judge took into account all relevant  matters  before
passing the sentence.  She prayed court to dismiss the appeal and to  uphold
the sentence.

It is trite law that this Court  would  only  interfere  with  the  sentence
passed if  it  is  illegal  or  manifestly  excessive  as  to  amount  to  a
miscarriage of justice.

In the instant case, appellant's counsel  has  attacked  the  learned  trial
judge for failure to take into account the period of  two  years  which  the
appellant spent on remand.  With due respect, his criticism  on  the  leaned
trial judge has no basis.  The record of appeal shows  that  before  passing
sentence the learned trial judge took  into  account  all  relevant  factors
including the period spent on remand.  Hence the record reads:

      "Court:    Though the convict is a  first  offender  who  has  pleaded
      guilty, I take serious view of this offence since it carried a maximum
      sentence of death.  There was  no  justification  whatsoever  for  the
      convict to which to have sexual intercourse with a minor  of  only  13
      years when he had a wife.  He was aged 29 years more  than  twice  the
      age of his victim.  I shall  pass  a  deterring  sentence  and  he  is
      therefore sentenced to 8 years imprisonment taking  into  account  the
      period he has been on remand."  (underlining ours)

The sentence of 8 years imprisonment was neither illegal nor excessive.  The
appeal is devoid of merit.  It is accordingly dismissed.
