Otieno v Republic  Division: Court of Appeal of Kenya at Kisumu  Date of judgment: 23 June 2006  Case Number: 6/05  Before: Bosire, Okubasu and Deverell JJA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: E Ongoya  [1] Criminal practice and procedure  Written submissions  Not permissible in criminal proceedings   Consequences of court accepting written submissions.  JUDGMENT  Bosire, OKubasu and Deverell JJA: Henry Odhiambo Otieno, the appellant, has come to us, on second appeal, challenging his conviction and sentence of three years imprisonment for the offence of grievous harm contrary to section 234 of the Penal Code. The appellants first appeal to the Superior Court was dismissed in its entirety. In the appeal before us, several issues have been raised, but we propose to deal with only one of those as we think it will dispose of this appeal. Although the appellant was duly represented by counsel during his trial, this case shows the dangers inherent in a situation where both the court and counsel make shortcuts to finalise matters they are seised of. It is a good thing when courts and counsel show a desire to urgently conclude matters. However, where as in this case justice is compromised the practice of making shortcuts, is to be depressed. What happened in this case? The appellant was tried by a Resident Magistrate, AN Kimani. He received evidence from both the prosecution and the defence. He then made the following order: Court Written submissions 24 May 2001. Judgment 5 June 2001 2pm. In obedience to that order, the defence counsel filed written submissions which the court considered in its judgment. It is, however, doubtful whether the appellant had access to them before judgment as after counsel prepared the same he must have passed them on to the trial magistrate. In Robert Fanali Akhuya v Republic criminal appeal number 42 of 2000 this Court dealt with a situation similar to this one and after quoting with approval the remarks of the Court of Appeal for Dean v Republic [1966] EA 272 itself said: On our part we say this. The Criminal Procedure Code provides a precedent for the making of submissions in the court. In no part of the legislation is there a mention of written submissions. A presiding officer of a court is expected to orally hear such submissions as both sides in a criminal case wish to make and to seek clarification of such submissions as found necessary, in order to appreciate each sides case before delivering his opinion. The accused person is also supposed to hear those submissions and has the right to clarify any point raised or to object to it being raised where he considers it necessary for his own benefit. Written submissions deny the accused that fundamental right. It is fundamental because if it were not so, the drafters of the Constitution of this Republic would not have entrenched it in the Constitution. Section 77(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Kenya, provides in pertinent part, as follows: 77 (2) Every person who is charged with a criminal offence. ( d) S hall be permitted to defend himself before the court in person or by a legal representative of his own choice. and except with his consent the trial shall not take place in his absence unless he so conducts himself as to render the continuance of the proceedings in his presence impossible and the court has ordered him to be remanded and the trial to proceed in his absence. It cannot be said that merely because the appellants counsel acceded to putting in written submissions the accused thereby consented to that course of events. The question as to whether or not written submissions could be put in was not put to him. The Constitution envisages express consent. So when section 213 and 310 of the Criminal Procedure Code are read with section 77(2) of the Constitution, it is clear that where written submissions are tendered without the accuseds express consent, the proceedings of the court concerned are thereafter rendered null and void. That is the conclusion we have come to herein. Accordingly, we order that the proceedings of the trial court after 8 May 2001 when the order for written submissions was made are null and void and thus render the appellants trial unsatisfactory. We have agonised on what order to make in the circumstances. Under the law as the trial of the appellant was unsatisfactory in ordinary circumstances a retrial would be ordered. However, in the circumstances of this case the long lapse of time since the appellants trial was concluded militates against such a course of action. The appellants trial was concluded in May 2001. Since then over five years have gone by. It might not be easy to trace witnesses and also, there may arise various improrable obstacles due to passage of time. That being the position we quash the appellants conviction, set aside the sentence which was imposed on him and order that the appellant be set at liberty forthwith, if under incarceration, unless otherwise lawfully held.
