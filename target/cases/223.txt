Khushal v Gilani  [1974] 1 EA 370 (HCK)  Division: High Court of Kenya at Nairobi  Date of judgment: 29 May 1974  Case Number: 2303/1973 (89/74)  Before: Harris J  Sourced by: LawAfrica  [1] Land  Caveat  Extension  Order must be served on registrar within 28 days  Registration of  Titles Act (Cap. 281) s. 57 (K.).  Editors Summary  The defendant lodged a caveat to protect the interest claimed by him in the suit. He was served with a  notice requiring removal of the caveat within 28 days and his application for its extension was heard after  the expiry of the 28 days.  The plaintiff contended that there was no jurisdiction to grant the application after the expiry of the  caveat, and the defendant contended that the application had been made within the 28 days.  Held  an order must be served on the registrar within 28 days.  Application dismissed.  Cases referred to Judgment:  (1) Parmer v. Singh (S.C.C.C. 259 of 1963) unreported.  (2) Mayers v. Akira Ranch Ltd. (No. 3), [1973] E.A. 431.  Judgment  Harris J: This is an application by chamber summons brought by the defendant for an order that a  caveat lodged by him under s. 57(1) of the Registration of Titles Act (Cap. 281) in respect of the suit  premises, which consist of a small plot of land with buildings thereon situate at Nakuru, be extended.  In the suit, which was field on 22 November 1973, the plaintiff claims possession of the premises  from the defendant who is alleged to have wrongfully seized and retained possession thereof. The  defendant in his defence claims that the plaintiff agreed to sell the premises to him and counterclaims for  specific performance.  On 5 February 1974 the defendant lodged his caveat claiming a purchasers interest and it appears that  on 8 April 1974 he received a notice from the registrar of titles under s. 57 (6) of the Act requiring the  withdrawal of the caveat in accordance with that sub-section within the next 28 days, that is, on or before  6 May 1974. On this day the present application was filed, supported by affidavit, seeking an order that  the caveat be extended until the finalisation of the suit.  Mr. Khannas main objection is based on the fact that the caveat had expired at least by 6 May with  the result that, in his submission, the court has now no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. In support  of this last matter he relied upon the unreported decision of Miles, J. dated 3 November 1964 in Parmer  v. Singh (S.C.C.C. 259 of 1963).  S. 57(6) of the Act is in the following terms:  Except in the case of a caveat lodged by the registrar, the caveatee may make application in writing to the  registrar to remove such caveat, and thereupon and upon payment of the prescribed fee the registrar shall give  Page 371 of [1974] 1 EA 370 (HCK)  twenty-eight days notice in writing to the caveator requiring that the caveat be withdrawn, and, after the lapse  of the service of such notice at the address mentioned in the caveat, the registrar shall remove such caveat  from the register by entering a memorandum that the same is discharged, unless he has been previously served  with an order of the court extending the time as herein provided.  In the course of his judgment Miles, J. said:  The operative word is clearly the word previously in subsection (6). This indicates that the registrar must  have been served with the order extending the caveat before the lapse of the twenty-eight days notice in  writing. It is not sufficient that the application for extension should have been filed or even the order obtained  within this period. The words, after the lapse of the service of such notice in subsection (6) are rather  peculiar and I do not know whether there is some typographical error. I can only construe these as meaning  after the lapse of twenty-eight days from the date of service of such notice. In this connection I would  observe that the notice given by the registrar specifies twenty-eight days from the date thereof.  The requirement that the order must be served on the registrar within the period of twenty-eight days is not  unreasonable since the lodging of a caveat is a substantial interference with the rights of a proprietor, and it is  not surprising that the legislature should have subjected it to stringent conditions. A period of twenty-eight  days is not inadequate, and it is to be noted that subsection (8) enables the caveator to apply for an extension  of time either before or after receiving the notice from the registrar. In many cases a caveator will have good  reason to anticipate that steps will be taken by the caveatee to have the caveat withdrawn under subsection (5)  of section 57. Section 63 of the Interpretation and General Provisions Act does not apply because this is a  case where a contrary intention appears.  Mr. Ndegwa for the defendant submitted that, since the notice from the registry had been received on 8  April 1974, expiring on 6 May, and since the present application had been filed on 6 May, the proposed  order if and when made should be given retrospective effect to that date. He contended that there was a  possibility that, despite the lapse of time, the registrar might not have yet removed the caveat and  therefore that the order, if now made and served expeditiously, might still be in time to save caveat.  I am satisfied that the application must fail. I agree with Mr. Khanna that the information before the  court is insufficient and I would refer the applicant to the decision of Spry, V.P. in Mayers v. Akira  Ranch Ltd. (No. 3), [1973] E.A. 431, where the desirability of a full disclosure of all relevant matters in  applications relating to caveats was pointed out. Furthermore, by virtue of O. 36 r. 3B, the application  should strictly speaking have been by originating summons under that Order and not by chamber  summons.  The principal ground upon which the application fails however is that of lack of jurisdiction for it is  clear that the registrar of titles is required by sub-s. (6) to remove the caveat immediately upon the  expiration of the statutory period of 28 days unless he had been previously served with an order of the  court extending the period of grace allowed to the caveator. At this stage it would be impossible to serve  any order now to be made within the time contemplated since this time has already expired and I cannot  entertain the possibility that the registrar has been so unaware of his duties as to omit to remove the  caveat on the due date.  Page 372 of [1974] 1 EA 370 (HCK)  Whatever hardship might be suffered by the defendant through the loss of the protecting caveat,  however, may to some extent be ameliorated by the provisions of s. 52 of the Transfer of Property Act  1882, precluding dealings with the premises pending the determination of the suit without an order of the  court.  The application is therefore dismissed with costs but in view of the difficulty of assessing at this stage  a fair instruction fee and of avoiding duplication of fees in the matter I will not as requested direct the  taxation and payment of such costs forthwith. The costs accordingly will form part of the plaintiffs costs  in the matter, being added to such other costs as he may be awarded.  Order accordingly.
