BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE YOROKAMU BAMWINE


J U D G M E N T:

The Plaintiff's claim against the Defendant is for recovery of
Shs.5,375,000-, damages and costs of the suit.

The Defendant was served summons to file a defence on 3/11/2004. He refused
and/or neglected to file a defence. An interlocutory Judgment was entered
against him on 23/11/2004. Accordingly, the case was put before me for
formal proof.

According to PW1 Deogratius Walukaga Kasozi, General Manager Ngege Ltd, the
Defendant was their fish supplier. In the course of time, he applied for a
loan from the Plaintiff for purposes of boosting his fish business. The
application was in writing and it is on record as P. Exh. 1. In this
application, the Defendant asked for a loan of Shs.8m. He undertook to
refund it in monthly instalments of Shs.800, 000-. In July 2002, he was
given Shs.2m. It is the evidence of this witness that as security for the
said loan, the supplier (Defendant) pledged his boat and engine. The
company did not take the security into its possession. The loan agreement
is on record as P. Exh. 11.

The witness further testified that in December 2002, the Plaintiff made
available to the Defendant fish nets worth Shs.6, 750,000-. The nets were
ordered from Uganda Fish Net Manufacturers Ltd and the Plaintiff paid for
them. The Defendant collected the Nets. This made the amount availed to the
Defendant stand at Shs.8, 750,000-. Out of this amount, the Defendant has
made a down payment of Shs.3, 300,000- by way of a refund. Hence the
balance of Shs.5, 375,000- which is still due and owing.

PW2 Mawanda Lwanga wrote the cheque on which the Defendant got the loan.
The cheque was for fish nets. It was drawn on Diamond Trust Bank for a sum
of shs.10m. Out of this Shs.10m, the Defendant's cut was Shs.6, 750,000-.
The other was for one Kasujja.

From the evidence of the Plaintiff's witnesses, the Defendant has since
disappeared. Under 0.8 r 3 of the Civil Procedure Rules, every allegation
of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary
implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite
party, shall be taken to be admitted. The Defendant was served, he did not
file a defence and Judgment in default was entered against him. His
liability to the Plaintiff was determined at that level.

Court is satisfied that the Defendant is still indebted to the Plaintiff in
the sum of Shs.5, 375,000-. The amount is accordingly decreed to the
Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff has prayed for monthly interest on the outstanding amount and
damages. The law is that when a party fails to do what he agreed to do or
does not do it properly, he is said to be in breach of the contract. He
will be liable to pay damages to the aggrieved party to compensate him for
any loss occasioned. The essence of awarding compensation to a party
aggrieved by breach of contract is for the Court to try as much as possible
to put the innocent party in the position he would have been in had the
contract been properly carried out. Baron Alderson in Hadley -Vs- Baxendale
(1854) 9 Exh. 341 while delivering Judgment of the Court established the
fundamental principles of assessing damages in breach of contract.
"Now we think that the proper rule in such a case as the present is this:
Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken, the
damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such a breach
of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as
either arising naturally, i.e. according to the usual course of things,
from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed
to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the
contract as the probable result of the breach of it."

In the instant case, counsel for the Plaintiff has invited Court to
consider the fact that the Plaintiff is a business entity engaged in the
business of fish. Denying it use of its money occasioned loss to it. I
agree.

Counsel has not suggested any figure which she would consider to be an
appropriate award for general damages. Damages are intended as compensation
for the Plaintiff's loss. They are not intended as punishment for the
Defendant. Bearing in mind the facts of the case; the amount of loss that
has presumably been occasioned to the Plaintiff; and the fact that the
Defendant had to turn to the Plaintiff for financial assistance to enhance
his fish business, I deem a sum of Shs.1,000,000- (one million only)
adequate compensation for the breach of contract.

The principal sum of Shs.5, 375,000- shall have interest accruing thereon
at the commercial rate from the date of filing the suit till payment in
full. The Plaintiff shall also be paid the costs of the suit.

In the result, Judgment is entered for the Plaintiff against the Defendant
as follows:
a. Special damages: Shs.5,375,000- (five million three hundred seventy five
thousand only).
b. General damages: Shs.1, 000,000- (one million only).
c. Interest on special damages at commercial rate from the date of filing
the suit till
payment in full.
d. Costs of the suit.
