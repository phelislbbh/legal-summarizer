DN Bahram and Company Limited and others v Tanzania Postal Bank and  others  Division: Court of Appeal of Tanzania at Dar-es-Salaam  Date of judgment: 8 September 2005  Case Number: 113/05  Before: Munuo JA  Sourced by: LawAfrica  Summarised by: R Rogo  [1] Civil procedure  Extension of time  Grounds for application for extension of time to serve  respondents with a Notice of Appeal and stay of execution.  Editors Summary  The three applicants through their advocate brought this application under rule 9(2)(b) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 1979 seeking extension of time to serve the respondents with a Notice of Appeal and stay of execution. The advocate stated that the application for leave to appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution because he had travelled to Mombasa and his counsel was sick on the hearing date. The learned Advocate, on his part at paragraph 5 of his affidavit said that he left the Notice of Appeal and the letter applying for copies of judgment, decree and proceedings at the Registry so that the Registrar would sign the same and cause the material documents to be served on the respondents. The first respondent bank however stated that the applicants were employing tactics to frustrate the process of law and that neither the alleged sickness of the applicants counsel nor the default to prosecute the application was communicated to the High Court so the material application had to be dismissed for want of prosecution on the 16 April, 2005. They also contended that the Notice of Appeal was not served on them due to lack of diligence on the part of the applicants and their counsel and thus, the present application should be rejected for want of merit.     Held  The supporting affidavits lack merit because if the applicants counsel was ill and if one of the applicants had travelled to Mombasa, communication would have been made to the trial court on the scheduled hearing. Had that been done, the application for leave to appeal would not have been dismissed for want of prosecution. The applicants delay in serving the respondent did not constitute sufficient ground for extending the sought period of serving the Notice of Appeal on the respondent. (Inspector Sadiki and others v Gerald Nkya [1997] TLR 290; Francis Itengeja v Kampuni ya Kusindika Mbegu za Mafuta Limited [1997] TLR 149; Transport Equipment Limited v DP Valambhia [1993] TLR 91 applied. The application was lacking in merit. Failure to serve the Notice of Appeal on the respondents rendered the intended appeal incompetent so the application for stay of execution was not sustainable in law. Application dismissed.

The application is supported by the affidavits of the  applicants advocate, Mr Mohamed IA Mkali and Mr Dadrahman Nurmohamed Abraham which  affidavits, counsel for the applicant adopted at the hearing.  Page 50 of [2006] 2 EA 48 (CAT)  In his affidavit, Mr Abraham stated at paragraph six that their application for leave to appeal was  dismissed for want of prosecution because he had travelled to Mombasa and his counsel was sick on the  hearing date. Mr Mkali, on his part, stated at paragraph 5 of his affidavit that he left the Notice of Appeal  and the letter applying for copies of judgment, decree and proceedings at the registry so that the Registrar  would sign the same and cause the material documents to be served on the respondents. He stated that  they had not been informed whether the registrar had signed the said documents. Hence the delay in  serving the respondents and the need for seeking extension of time to serve the respondents.  Mr Nkuba, a principal officer of the first respondent bank deponed to a counter-affidavit stating that  the applicants are employing delaying tactics to frustrate the process of law. He further stated that neither  the alleged sickness of the applicants counsel nor the default to prosecute the application for leave to  appeal to this Court was communicated to the High Court so the material application had to be dismissed  for want of prosecution on the 16 April 2005. In short the respondents contend that the Notice of Appeal  was not served on them due to lack of diligence on the part of the applicants and their counsel so the  present application should be rejected for want of merit.  Contending that the intended appeal is incompetent, Mr Malimi observed that the Notice of Appeal  was lodged on the 21 March 2005 and should have been served on the respondents within seven days  under rule 77(1) of the court rules. It is the contention of counsel for the respondents that there is no  sufficient ground for extending the period for serving the respondents with the Notice of Appeal. In the  absence of a valid Notice of Appeal the intended appeal is incompetent, he argued. Counsel for the  respondents cited a number of cases in which the court rejected applications for extension of time to  serve Notices of Appeal on the ground that there was no sufficient reason for extending time. He urged  the court to do the same in the present application.  It appears to me that, the affidavits in support of the application lack merit because if the applicants  counsel was ill, and, or if one of the applicants had travelled to Mombasa, communication would have  been made to trial court on the scheduled hearing. Had that been done, the application for leave to appeal  would not have been dismissed for want of prosecution.  With regard to extension of the period of serving the Notice of Appeal on the respondents, I find no  ground for doing so. In the case of Inspector Sadiki and others v Gerald Nkya [1997] TLR 290, the  applicants filed a Notice of Appeal within 6 days of the judgment having been granted but neither the  Notice of Appeal nor the letter requesting copies of judgment, decree and proceedings were served on the  respondents, just as was the case here. In the said case, the court held that the applicants delay in serving  the respondent did not constitute sufficient ground for extending the sought period of serving the said  Notice of Appeal on the respondent.  In another case, Francis Itengeja v Kampuni ya Kusindika Mbegu za Mafuta Limited [1997] TLR 149,  the applicant sought to strike out the appeal because the Notice of Appeal had not been served on him nor  had the appeal been lodged within fixed period of sixty days. On the issue of not serving the Notice of  Appeal on the respondent, the court held that:  The failure to serve the applicant with a copy of the Notice of Appeal within 7 days as required by rule 77(1)  warranted striking out the appeal.  Page 51 of [2006] 2 EA 48 (CAT)  Likewise, the court could not find sufficient reason for extending the period of serving the respondent  with the Notice of Appeal in the case of Transport Equipment Limited v DP Valambhia [1993] TLR 91.  In the present case, there is simply no sufficient ground and to be fair no ground at all for extending the  period of serving the respondents because the applicants counsel left the Notices of Appeal at the  Registry instead of effecting, and, or seeing to it that service was effected on the respondents within  seven days pursuant to rule 77(1) of the Tanzania Court of Appeal Rules 1979.  Under the circumstances this application is lacking in merit. Failure to serve the Notice of Appeal on  the respondents rendered intended appeal incompetent so the application for stay of execution is not  sustainable in law. I accordingly dismiss the application with costs.  For the appellant:  Mr Mkali  For the respondent:  Mr Malimi
