RULING

The plaintiff brought this action to recover from the defendant
Shs8,269,553,502.00, damages, interest and costs of the suit. The plaintiff
contended in the plaint that it had ordered assorted steel from the
defendant for the sum of US$29,033,900.00. The plaintiff contended that it
had deposited monies on the defendants account for the steel and even paid
Shs. 8,269,553,502.00 being the vat component to the defendant's tax
benefit.
The plaintiff further contended in its plaint that the defendant supplied
only a token quantity of steel and it refused to supply the quantity
contracted despite its holding unspecified sums of money on its deposit
account and Shs.8,269,553,502.00 on its tax account. In light of the
defendant's refusal or failure to supply the steel, the plaintiff contended
it had suffered damage and therefore brought this action to recover from
the defendant the sum of Shs.8,269,553,502.00, damages, interest and costs
of the suit.
The defendant, in response to the plaintiff's claim, claimed that the
performance of this contract, was frustrated by the actions of the Uganda
Revenue Authority, which had directed the defendant, not to continue with
the supplies of steel to the plaintiff. The defendant further stated, in
part in paragraph 3 thereof,
           '(e) The defendant as the taxable person for the taxable supply
           of steel to the Plaintiff under the contract which is the
           subject of this suit acknowledges only Ushs.8,255,126,042.00 and
           not Ushs.8,269,553,502.00. as the balance due on pre-paid VAT by
           the plaintiff which is held on the defendants VAT account with
           the Uganda Revenue Authority.
                                             (f) The Defendant denies
           liability or at all for the failure to honour the supply of the
           steel to the Plaintiff as to the knowledge of the Plaintiff, the
           contract was frustrated by URA's administrative directives not
           to supply which functionally disabled the Defendant's capacity
           to perform.'
The plaintiff on the basis of this written statement of defence wrote to
the Registrar of this court, on 13 July 2006, stating in part,
           'The Defendant filed and served us with a written statement of
           defence substantially admitting the Plaintiff's claim in the
           amount of Ushs.8,255,126,042/= as paragraph 3(e) thereof can
           refer. We therefore pray for judgment to be entered upon the
           said admitted sum as pleaded by the Defendant under O.11 r.6 CPR
           (as amended).'
The Registrar proceeded to enter judgement as requested and a formal decree
was extracted on the 13 July 2006.
The plaintiff, now judgment debtor, without delay, on the 14 July 2006
applied for attachment of this sum of Shs.8,255,126,042.00 held by Uganda
Revenue Authority on the judgment debtor's VAT account with that
organisation. The Registrar of this court, issued an order for attachment
of the said sum against Uganda Revenue Authority. The order of attachment
is dated 7th July 2006, which I presume must be a mistake, as of that date
no judgment had been entered in this case. He ordered Uganda Revenue
Authority to appear before him on the 21st July 2006, on  a hearing of the
said application.
Uganda Revenue Authority responded with an affidavit sworn by Ms Jacqueline
Kobusingye, the Commissioner for Domestic Taxes in Uganda Revenue
Authority. I shall set out, in part, portions of her affidavit.
           '3. That on or about the 30th August 2005, the applicant
           requested the Government of Uganda for assistance to pay taxes
           on construction materials for its University Teaching Hospital
           at Ishaka in Bushenyi.
                     4. That the request for assistance was in respect of
           Value Added Tax on cement, iron bars, and science equipment.
                         5. That by the letter dated 11th October 2005, the
           request was granted. Copy of the letter is hereto annexed as
           "A".  6. That on 30th November 2005, the Government of Uganda
           paid to the garnishee VAT of U.Shs.8,269,553,502 in respect of
           the iron bars to be supplied by Steel Rolling Mills to the
           Applicant.
                       7. That the payment was held on a Gross Payment
           Account, in favour of Kampala International University and the
           Garnishee would only off-set and pay itself VAT on receiving
           evidence of any supplies made by Steel Rolling Mills.

                           8. That the above arrangement was agreed between
           the applicant, the Respondent and the Garnishee as confirmed in
           the minutes of a meeting held on the 27/02/06 a copy of which is
           herewith annexed as "B" hereto.
                9. That the respondent has to date made supplies of
           U.shs.146,257,356/=  and the garnishee has off-set and paid
           itself U.shs.26,326,324/= from the Gross Payment Account. 10.
           That the balance of U.shs.8,255,126,042/= on the Gross payment
           Account is money held in trust by the Garnishee on behalf of the
           Government of Uganda, and only accrues to the Garnishee as VAT
           component of any supplies made by the respondent to the
           Applicant.                                                 11.
           That the amount of U.shs.8,255,126,042/= on the Gross Payment
           Account is not a debt owed to the respondent, nor  a debt
           accruing to it, but money held on behalf of the Government of
           Uganda, administered by the Garnishee to ensure that VAT payment
           is honoured.'
The applicant responded with an affidavit in rejoinder sworn by Deo
Betungura, the Vice Chancellor of the applicant which in effect says the
sum in contention was an unrefundable contribution by government to the
applicant to construct a teaching hospital. After the frustration of the
contract to supply steel to the applicant, the affidavit contends that this
money is now due to the judgment debtor as the taxable entity  and that the
money is not held in trust for government.
The Registrar of this court then summoned the Attorney General to come and
make his claim to the money in question, in accordance with Order 23 Rule 5
of the Civil Procedure Rules. The Attorney General responded and filed an
affidavit in reply. The Judgment Creditor, the garnishee, and the Attorney
General appeared before the Registrar on the claim by the Attorney General.
After hearing the Attorney General and framing the issues, the registrar
decided to refer this matter to me, considering the magnitude of the
subject matter and the complexity of the issues raised.
I ordered the parties to appear before me on 23 August 2006, and on that
date, proceeded with the hearing of the third party claim filed by the
Attorney General and now proceed to give my decision.
In support of the position of the third party, an affidavit sworn by Mr.
Lawrence Kizza was filed. Mr. Kiiza is the Acting Director, Economic
Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. He
recited the background to the payment to Uganda Revenue Authority of the
money in question. And he then went further to state, in part,
           '5. That the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
           Development issued a tax cheque to Uganda Revenue Authority of
           Ug.Shs.8,269,533,502/= towards payment of Value Added Tax (VAT)
           on 35,000 tons of iron bars marked Annexture "A".
                                                              6. That the
           said cheque was not a direct cash benefit to Kampala
           International University but a document specifically as evidence
           of Government payment of taxes. 7. That in all payments of taxes
           by Government on behalf of private enterprises are not cash
           payments which can be transferred to a person but are meant to
           be banked only in the Consolidated Tax Account.
                                                       8. That the Uganda
           Revenue Authority (URA) issued an assessment of
           Ug.Shs.8,269,553,502/= towards payment of VAT on 35,000 tons of
           iron bars which was the paid at Bank of Uganda by Ministry of
           Finance, Planning and Economic Development on 30/11/2005, and
           Uganda Revenue Authority was advised of the same vide Bank of
           Uganda T111 No. 002328 of 30/11/2005, and cheque attached hereto
           and marked as Annexture "B".                              9.
           that I know that on the same date 30/11/2005 the aforementioned
           sum of money Shs.8,269,553,502/= was credited on the Uganda
           Revenue Account and on 02/12/2005 transferred. Attached is a
           copy of the transfers marked Annexture "C".
                                                      10 That I know that
           on the 02/12/2005, the said amount was transferred to the Uganda
           Consolidated Fund, Government Tax Account.'
Mr. Kavuma Kabenge, learned counsel for the applicant/judgment creditor, if
I can correctly summarise his position, argued before me that neither the
applicant nor Government of Uganda were a  taxable entity for purposes of
VAT. The only taxable entity under VAT was the judgment debtor, and it
followed that any unused funds for tax purposes are now a debt due to the
judgment debtor, which is attachable.
Ms Angela Kiryabwire, learned Principal State Attorney, appearing for the
Attorney General, argued that the transaction in question was essentially a
paper transaction, created to support the tax exemption on the steel that
was supposed to have been supplied to the Judgment creditor by the judgment
debtor. There is no money available with Uganda Revenue Authority that can
be attached as debt.
I have carefully considered all the affidavits filed both in support of the
attachment for the applicant, and against attachment for the third party
and garnishee. I have also taken into account the submissions of counsel in
this matter. The facts are very simple.
It has clearly been established that the Government paid the vat component
of steel supplies to be made to the applicant. Government paid this money
to the revenue collection agency, the garnishee in these proceedings. This
money was not paid to either the judgment creditor or the judgment debtor.
It appears common cause between the two, the judgment creditor and judgment
debtor, that this contract is now frustrated. The consequences of the
frustration are not in issue here.
What is in issue here is whether the pre paid unused VAT payment is held as
a debt to the judgment debtor, as contended by the judgment creditor, or
not. The judgment debtor is not party to these proceedings. It has not
claimed that it has VAT refunds due to it from the Uganda Revenue
Authority, and even if it had so claimed, this is not to the knowledge of
this court, in these proceedings. I am doubtful that a VAT refund claim, if
there was such a claim due, would amount to an attachable debt without
being processed under the procedures set out in the Value Added Tax Act.
That is a matter I do not have to decide in these proceedings.
I am unable to see, on the facts put forth, what sums of money, if any,
Uganda Revenue Authority holds for the benefit of the judgment debtor. The
funds pointed to, and now sought to be attached, were paid, by Government
of Uganda, and not the taxable entity, the judgment debtor in this case, to
Uganda Revenue Authority, as pre payment of taxes, for the benefit of the
judgment creditor, for onward transmission to the Consolidated Fund. It is,
of course, here immaterial that the payment was for the benefit of the
judgment creditor.
The judgment debtor has made no claim on Uganda Revenue Authority, or on
any of the monies that Uganda Revenue Authority received. It is simply
preposterous for the judgment creditor to purport to attach a non-existent
debt between the judgment debtor and the garnishee. The consequences of the
frustration of the contract between the judgment creditor and the judgment
debtor, which on the face of it, now include this judgment debt, cannot be
sorted out by execution proceedings of this nature, which amount to no more
than an illegal raid on the consolidated fund.
The Uganda Revenue Authority is obliged by Section 14 of the Uganda Revenue
Authority Act, to place all revenue it collects or that is due and payable,
on the Consolidated Fund. What ever money Uganda Revenue Authority receives
on account of taxes is held in trust for the Government of Uganda. It is
the Government of Uganda that is the party that has a claim on the funds
sought to be attached in this case, on two accounts.
Firstly, if it is tax revenue, then, the funds in question, without
question, belong to the Government of Uganda by law. If on the other hand,
the funds in question are not considered revenue, as the goods were not
supplied, the Government of Uganda, which was the payee, and has always
been the owner thereof, has a lien, or charge on the same, until otherwise
established. That explains why the Government of Uganda did not pay this
money to the Judgment Creditor or the Judgment debtor in the first place.
I am satisfied that the claim of the Government of Uganda on the funds in
question has been amply established. I declare that the said funds are not
liable to attachment. I set aside the order of attachment issued by the
Registrar in this case.
In light of the foregoing decisions, I dismiss the application by the
judgment creditor to attach the funds in question, with costs, to both
Uganda Revenue Authority and the Attorney General.
Signed, dated and delivered at Kampala this 30th  day of August 2006
