BENON TUMUMSHEMEREIRWE............................. PLAINTIFF


                                   VERSUS
TUMURAMYE BENARD  .......................................DEFENDANT



                    BEFORE: HON. JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA

                                  JUDGMENT:

The plaintiff, Benon Tumushemereirwe filed this suit against  the  defendant
Tumuramye Bernard, claiming liquidated sum of shs33, 030,000/=  plus  costs.
The plaintiff's claim is that on 28th February 2004, the defendant  obtained
a friendly advance of Shs33, 030,000/= interest free from him.  As  security
thereof the defendant issued to the plaintiff a post-dated  Commercial  Bank
Cheque No. 025408 in the said sum as  repayment  on  or  before  30th  April
2004.  The cheque was dishonored when presented for payment.

In his Written Statement of Defence the defendant denied obtaining any loan
from the plaintiff.  Denied having issued the cheque and contended that the
cheque was drawn and issued by Akim Construction Company Ltd which is a
separate legal entity from the defendant.

Representation was Mr. Alex Bashasha for Plaintiff and Mr. Gilbert Nuwagaba
for the defendant.

The following issues were framed by the parties for Court's determination:-

Whether the plaintiff advanced the sum of Shs33, 030,000/= to the
defendant?
Whether the cheque No. 025408 was issued by the defendant as security for
payment of the above sum?
If the above sum was advanced, whether it has been paid back?
Whether the plaintiff is entitled to the remedies sought?

I intend to consider the first and second issue together.  The plaintiff
testified that himself and the defendant were old friends and used to deal
in business together.  That the defendant was constructing a market for
Kabale Municipal Council.  He was short of money and approached the
plaintiff for a loan.  The plaintiff lent a sum ofshs33, 000,000/= to the
defendant which he gave to him in cash.  That he also gave a mattress to
the defendant on Credit worth Shs30, 000/=.  This was on 28th February
2004.  As security for payment the defendant issued the plaintiff a cheque
in the sum of 33,030,000/=, the total sum claimed in this suit.  When the
defendant refused to pay back the money, the plaintiff banked the cheque
but it bounced as there was no money.  The cheque was marked "Refer to
Drawer."

When the plaintiff gave the defendant the loan money and the mattress on
credit, it was only himself and the defendant present.  Apart from the
cheque issued by the defendant there was no written document to witness the
loan or the mattress credit.

The defendant in his testimony stated that he used to borrow money from the
plaintiff which he would pay back with interest.  That in November 2003 he
had borrowed shs8, 500,000/= from the plaintiff on behalf of Akim
Construction Co. Ltd, where he is the managing Director.  Money was to be
paid back with interest of 40% per month.  There was no agreement written.
As security for repayment of the loan sum and interest the defendant issued
the plaintiff with the said company's cheque in the sum of Shs33,
030,000/=.  The defendant denied that he had been given a mattress on
credit.  He stated that the sum of shs30, 000/= had been added so as to
disguise the fact that the money borrowed carried interest.  He stated that
it had been agreed between him and the plaintiff that the total interest
payable would be calculated at the time of payment, after payment of which
and of the principal sum the plaintiff was to return the cheque to the
defendant.



 From the evidence of the plaintiff and defendant three facts are clear.
First that the defendant sought and obtained a loan from the plaintiff.
Secondly, that a cheque in the sum of Shs33, 030,000/= was issued in
respect of the loan.  Thirdly, that when presented for payment the cheque
was returned to the plaintiff unpaid and marked "Refer to Drawer."

To resolve the issues at hand the following questions have to be answered:-

How much was the loan?
To whom was the loan given?

According to the plaintiff, he on 28th February 2004 advanced a loan of
Shs33.000, 000/= which he gave to the defendant in cash.  He also sold the
defendant a mattress on credit worth Shs30, 000/= Thus the total sum of
33,030,000/= for which he was issued with a cheque in the sum of shs33,
030,000/= post dated to 30th April 2004.

According to the defendant he was advanced a loan of Shs8, 500,000/= in
November 2003.  That it was attracting a monthly interest of 40%.  At 40%
monthly interest the sum of shs8, 500, 000, /= would earn the plaintiff a
monthly additional sum of Shs3, 400,000/=.  He denies having been given a
loan of Shs33, 000,000/= and denies taking a mattress worth 30,000/= on
credit.  He however, accepts having issued a cheque to the plaintiff in the
sum of Shs33, 030,000/= post dated 30th April 2004.

There was no written agreement between the parties to govern the loan
agreement between them.  The only written document, and accepted by both
parties, which related to the loan transaction between them was the cheque.
 The cheque was issued to the plaintiff by the defendant to secure the
loan.  Both accept that it was in the sum of shs33, 030,000/= and postdated
30th April 2004.

The Bills of Exchange  Act, Section 72 (I) defines a cheque as a bill of
exchange drawn on a banker payable on demand.  In addition to being drawn
on a banker, a cheque must conform to the requisites laid down by the Bills
of Exchange Act as   necessary to constitute a bill. Section 2 (I) of the
Act states:

    "A Bill of Exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed  by
    one person  to another, signed by the person to  giving  it,  requiring
    the person  to whom it is addressed to pay on demand or at a  fixed  or
    determined future time a sum certain in money to or to the  order of  a
    specified person or to bearer."


The Encyclopaedia of Banking Law, page D33 states  that  although  a  cheque
must be payable on demand, this requirement  does  not  invalidate  a  post-
dated cheque.  The effect is that a post-dated cheque is a bill of  exchange
payable at a future date.  Payment would be of the amount appearing  on  the
cheque both in words and figures.   The  cheque  in  the  instant  case  was
ordering payment of a sum certain in money, that is shs33, 030,000/= to  the
plaintiff on 30th April, 2004.  In his testimony the  plaintiff  stated  how
the sum of Shs33, 030,000/= was arrived at.   Shs 33,000,000  was  the  cash
loan advanced by him to the defendant.   Shs  30,000/=  was  payment  for  a
mattress given to the defendant on credit.

To the contrary the defendant states that though he issued out the cheque
in the sum of shs33, 030,000/= he was only given a loan of shs8, 500,000/=
attracting interest of 40% per month.  He denies being given a mattress on
credit.  Assuming the  loan was given on 28th February 2004 for  the two
months - that is by  30th April 2004, the due date of the cheque, the sum
of shs8,500,000/= would have earned a total interest of shs6,400,000/=.
Hence a total of shs15, 300,000/= principal sum plus interest,, This is
less than the sum of shs33,030,000/= on the cheque.  If I go by the
defendant's date of issue of the loan which he says was November 2003, for
the period of six months that is by 30th April 2004, the  sum of
shs8,500,000/= would have earned a total interest of Shs20,400,000/=.
Hence a total of 28,900,000/= principal sum plus interest.  Again this
would be less than the sum of Shs33, 030,000/=.

The defendant does not give a satisfactory reason why he had issued a
cheque in figures higher than what he was supposed to pay.  All that the
defendant stated in his evidence was:

    "The cheque issued was for Shs33, 030,000/- because the company did not
    have security.  Otherwise,  the  loan  was  of  Shs8,  500,000/=.   The
    plaintiff did not give me a mattress.  The plaintiff added  the  Shs30,
    000/= saying that so that people do not know that  this  money  carried
    interest."

If the defendant is to be believed that there was an  intention  to  conceal
the interest charged, logic would have been to compute the interest  payable
over the loan period, add the principle loan sum and write out a  cheque  in
the accumulated sum of the principle plus interest.  This was not the  case.


The  defendant and DW2 Deus Byaruhanga, stated that in a meeting attended
by  both the plaintiff and the defendant,  the plaintiff's wife, the
defendant's  wife and Byaruhanga, the plaintiff stated that he had given
the defendant a loan of shs11,500,000/=.  DW2 stated that:-

    "-We asked how it had come to Shs33, 030,000/=. The plaintiff  told  us
    that he had  lent  the  defendant  Shs.11,  500,000/=  which  had  with
    interest come to shs33, 030,000/="

Even with the sum of Shs11, 500,000/= as the principal, at 40% interest  per
month it would earn shs4, 600,000 per month.  In a period of six  months  it
would on 30th  April  2004  have  earned  a  total  of  Shs27,600,000/=   in
interest.  That interest plus the loan sum of shs11, 500,000/= would make  a
total of Shs39, 100,000/= which is higher than the amount on the cheque.

In his evidence the plaintiff testified that the defendant had issued to
him the cheque as security for payment of the sum of shs33, 030,000/=.  The
defendant also testified that he issued that cheque as security.  In light
of the above testimony by both parties admitting that a cheque was issued
and that it was issued as security the defendant's Counsels' submission
that the security mentioned is non-existent merely because it was not
tendered in evidence cannot be sustained.

I have carefully considered the plaintiff's evidence and that of the
defendant and I find that the plaintiff advanced a sum of shs33, 030,000/=
and cheque No.025408 was issued as security for payment of the above sum.
The remaining issue is whether the loan was advanced to the defendant or
not.  In his Written Statement of defence the defendant stated:-

    "5(a) That he has never obtained a loan (friendly  or  otherwise)  from
    the plaintiff in the sum of Ugshs 33,030,000/= (shillings thirty  three
    million thirty thousand only) or any other sum for that matter.


(b) ---

(c) That the Uganda Commercial Bank cheque was drawn and issued by Akim
Construction Company Limited which is a separate legal entity from the
defendant and the defendant further avers that actions of the company
cannot be ascribed to him personally."

The cheque which had been issued to the plaintiff and which bounced was  not
tendered in evidence.  However, the photocopy annexture "A"  to  the  plaint
shows the holder or title of the account was Akim Construction Co Ltd.   The
defendant's uncontradicted  evidence  is  that  the  company  is  a  limited
liability company with two shareholders and directors, namely the  defendant
and his wife Jackline Ariko.

The defendant testified that the plaintiff gave the loan to Akim
Construction Co Ltd for the competition of a contract between the company
and Kabale Municipal Council.  That he had borrowed the money on behalf of
the company after a meeting with his wife at which they agreed to borrow
money.

That since the company had no other form of security the plaintiff asked to
be given as security a cheque in the sum of Shs33,030,000/=.  The defendant
accordingly issued the plaintiff with the company cheque.

The plaintiff in his testimony stated:

    The defendant was constructing a market and I had guaranteed for him to
    put up that market.  The defendant came to me that  I  guarantee  (read
    advance) him Shs33, 030,000/= to put up the market.   He  was  building
    the market for Kabale Municipal Council.  The defendant came to  me  to
    assist him with money and he gave me a cheque as security."


While being cross-examined the plaintiff said that  he  had  guaranteed  the
defendant as a friend when the defendant contracted  to  build  the  market.
That he had advanced  the  loan  to  the  defendant  out  of  concern  as  a
guarantor of the defendant on the construction agreement  to  ensure  he  is
not held liable for the defendant's failure to complete the construction  of
the market.  He  identified  exhibit  D1  as  the  agreement  which  he  had
witnessed.   The  agreement  was  between  Kabale  Municipality   and   Ahim
Construction Ltd, the  contractor.   The  agreement  where  marked  "Binding
Signature and Seal of the contractor"  it is  signed  by  Bernard  Tumuramye
(the defendant) and as witness to  that  signature  is  Benon  Tushemereirwe
(the plaintiff).

Section 109 (c) of the Companies Act requires every company to:-

    "-have its name mentioned in legible  Roman  letters  in  all  business
    letters  of  the  company  and  in  all  notice  and   other   official
    publications of the company, and in all bills of  exchange,  promissory
    notes, endorsements, cheques and orders for money or  goods  purporting
    to be signed by or on behalf of  the  company,  and  in  all  bills  of
    parcels, invoices, receipts and letters of credit of the company."

The cheque issued to the plaintiff was clearly marked drawn  on  account  of
Ahim Construction Co. Ltd.  The construction agreement  was  clearly  marked
between Kabale Municipality and Akim Construction Ltd.   The  two  documents
complied with the provisions of section 109 (c) above.

Counsel for the defendant submitted that the defendant cannot be held
personally liable for the cheque which clearly indicated that the drawer
was Ahim Construction Co Ltd.  He argued that the defendant was merely
signing for and on behalf of the said company.  Counsel further submitted
that both parties were consistent on the fact that money borrowed was for
purposes of constructing a market.  He argued that it was clear that the
construction of the market was being undertaken by Ahim Construction Co
Ltd.  He further argued that the mere fact that the defendant signed the
cheque does not make him liable.

True a limited liability company is a legal entity distinct from its
shareholders, directors or officials.  In Sentamu Vs Uganda Commercial Bank
& Anor (1983) HCB 61 Justice Benjamin Odoki (as he was) held that a limited
liability company is a separate legal entity from it directors,
shareholders and other members.  Individual members of the company are not
liable for the company's debts.

On the other hand Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the defendant
under cross-examination confessed that there was no resolution by Ahim
Construction Co. Ltd authorizing him to borrow any money on its behalf.
Counsel argued that in borrowing money on behalf of the company without a
resolution sanctioning the same the defendant acted contrary to the company
rules.  He therefore submitted that as such the cheque issued was personal
security by the defendant for the sum of shs33, 030,000/=.

In his evidence the defendant in cross examination states that there was no
company resolution to borrow the money.  He went on to say:-

    "We were two signatories with my wife.  My wife did  not  sign  on  the
    cheque because it was simply a security and the plaintiff  was  not  to
    present it but to return it on payment.-"

A bank can only pay a cheque drawn pursuant to the customer's mandate.

Section 29(I) the Bills of Exchange Act  provides that every party whose
signature appears on a bill is prima facie deemed to have become  a party
to it for value.  On the basis of this provision counsel for the plaintiff
submitted that the defendant is liable for the amount on the cheque.
However as rightly submitted by counsel for the defendant, the above
section cannot be read in isolation of section 109 (I) of the Companies
Act.  The cheque clearly indicated that the account holder was Ahim
Construction Co Ltd.  Anybody who signs on the cheque must do so on behalf
of the said company.  He however had to so sign pursuant to the Company's
mandate to the bank.  There was no mandate adduced in evidence but from the
defendant's statement in cross examination, above, it is clear that the
mandate was two signatories, that is the defendant and his wife jointly.
That the defendant had signed alone because the cheque was not intended to
be presented to the bank for payment, otherwise his wife would have also
signed.  Therefore it is apparent that the defendant in issuing the
plaintiff with the company's cheque his intention was merely to satisfy the
plaintiff's demand for security but not to bind the company.  This supports
the plaintiff's contention that the loan was advanced to the defendant.
Therefore the first and second issues are answered in affirmative.

3rd issue - If the above sum was advanced, whether it has been paid back?
Money advanced as a loan must be paid back.  The plaintiff stated that when
he asked the defendant to pay back his money, the defendant denied having
borrowed any money from him and alleged that the plaintiff had forged the
cheque.  The plaintiff reacted by banking the cheque but it bounced.  He
stated that the cheque, when presented for payment, was returned unpaid and
marked "Refer to Drawer." In cross examination he stated that he did not
give the defendant a notice of dishonor but instead made a report to the
police.

The plaintiff did not tender in evidence the said cheque.  He stated that
in July 2004 he had failed to trace it.  He tendered in evidence a letter
from Kabale Police Station dated 19th September 2004 - exhibit P1.  The
letter stated that the plaintiff had reported a case of loss of Uganda
Commercial Bank cheque for 33,030,000/= which occurred on 27th June 2004.

Section 46 (2) of the Bills of Exchange Act provides:-
    "Subject to this Act, when a bill  is  dishonoured  by  nonpayment,  an
    immediate right of recourse against the drawer and endorser accrues  to
    the holder."

While section 47 of the said Act states:-
    "Subject to this Act, when a bill has been dishonoured by nonacceptance
    or by nonpayment, notice of dishonor must be given to  the  drawer  and
    each endorser, and a drawer or endorser to whom the notice is not given
    is discharged, ---"


Then section 48 provides:-
    "Notice of dishonor in order to be valid and effectual must be given in
    accordance with the following  rules -


(c) The notice may be given as soon as the bill is dishonoured, and must be
given within a reasonable time thereafter.  In the absence of special
circumstances, notice is not deemed to have been given within a reasonable
time unless-


where the person giving and the person receiving notice reside in the same
place, the notice is given or sent off in time to reach the latter on the
day after the dishonour of the bill;
where the person giving and the person to receive notice reside  in
different places, the notice is set off on the day after the dishonour of
the bill, if there is a post at a convenient hour on that day, and if there
is no such post on that day  then by the next post thereafter."


   The plaintiff testified that he had deposited the cheque on  his  account
   on 30th April 2004 and it was returned to him unpaid on 3rd May 2004.  He
   therefore got notice of the dishonour on 3rd May 2004.


Counsel for the defendant submitted that both parties testified that they
lived in Kabale and knew each others home.  He argued that in the
circumstances the notice of dishonour ought to have reached the defendant
as Director of Ahim Construction Co Ltd or the drawer within 24 hours. The
testimony is that no Notice of dishonour was given at all.  Counsel
therefore submitted that the plaintiff's action is not only barred by time
but the drawer of the cheque is discharged from all liability for non
issuance of the Notice of dishonor.  He relied on the cases of J.B.
Turyagyenda Vs Charles Tumwesigye HC.C.S No 57 of 2000 and Nanji Khodabhai
Vs Sohan Sigh & Anor (1957) EA 291

In Turyagyenda Vs Tumweisgye (Supra) the cheque was dishonored on the 2nd
September 1997 and notice of dishonour given on 2nd February 1998 - that is
five months later.  Justice C. K. Byamugisha held that the plaintiff's
action is barred by law in that he cannot sue on the cheque for failing to
give notice within a reasonable time.

In Khodabhai Vs Sigh (supra) where Notice of dishonour of a cheque was not
given to the second defendant within reasonable time Keatinge J. held that
since the plaintiff had failed to give due notice of dishonour, the
liability of the second defendant on both notes and the antecedent
agreement were discharged.

The above two cases are however distinguishable from the instance case.  In
the Turyagyenda Vs Tumwesigye case the plaintiff had already received part
payment of the cheque sum.  Therefore, in addition to failure to give
notice of dishonour of the cheque the learned judge found that the
plaintiff could only sue the defendant for the balance on the alleged loan
and the cheque was no longer a basis for his cause of action.  While in the
Khohabhair Vs Sigh case the cheque was issued in payment of the loan sum.
In the instant case it is the testimony of both parties that the cheque was
issued only as security for payment of the loan sum.  It is so stated in
paragraph 4 (b) of the plaint that as security for the said advance, the
defendant issued the plaintiff a post dated Commercial Bank Cheque No.
025408.

The cheque having not been issued and /or received in satisfaction for the
loan it could only operate as a collateral security.  The plaintiff could
proceed to recover the loan sum and this in what he did.  However before he
could proceed against the defendant for refusal to pay the loan sum it was
only logical for him to present the cheque deposited as security for
payment.

In Re: Hone ( a bankrupt ) Exparte The Trustee Vs Keinsthon Borough Council
(5) (1950) 2 All ER 716, Harman J said:-


    "It is quite true the council could not have sued for the money, having
    accepted the cheque, until the cheque was dishonoured.  Nevertheless it
    was not till the Council collected it that it was paid"


   A cheque unless dishonoured is payment when  it  is  cleared:   Byles  on
   Bills of Exchange (21st Edn) Page 24.


It is an undisputed fact that the cheque was not paid, it was dishonoured.
The defendant stated that the amount on the cheque was arbitrarily
determined by the plaintiff but that the parties had agreed that upon the
company being paid   by Kabale Municipal Council, they would sit and
compute the amount due and that the said cheque would be returned to the
defendant upon payment of the sum then agreed.   Counsel for the defendant
submitted that indeed at the time of payment, the parties sharply disagreed
on the amount payable prompting the involvement of Deus Byaruhanga DW2 in
trying to resolve the dispute.

Both the defendant and DW2, testified that a meeting was held at the
plaintiff's home, where in the presence of DW2 the plaintiff and his wife
and the defendant and his wife; the defendant stated that he had borrowed
Shs8, 500,000/= while the plaintiff stated it was Shs11, 500,000/= plus
interest.  That the defendant offered to settle at Shs 15,000,000/= but the
plaintiff refused and his last offer was Shs18, 000,000/=.  The
negotiations having failed DW2 and the defendant with his wife left.  That
after they had left the plaintiff  called them  back, on their respective
phones, and asked them to come back that he was willing accept the
defendant's offer of Shs15,000,000/=.  Both DW2 and the defendant testified
that on return the defendant paid shs10, 000,000/= cash and shs5, 000,000/=
by postdated cheque.  That upon receipt of the cash and cheque the
plaintiff handed over the Shs33, 030,000/= cheque to DW2 who later handed
it over to the defendant.  The defendant stated that upon the cheque being
handed over to him he destroyed the same.  The defendant' contends that
after that payment there was no more money due from him to the plaintiff.

Counsel for the defendant submitted that the Shs15, 000,000/= paid to the
plaintiff was in full and final settlement of his claim. That it
extinguished the plaintiff's claim.  The plaintiff's counsel relying on the
inconsistencies in the defendant's testimony in court and his statement to
the Police submitted that the defendant never paid back any money to the
plaintiff.  Though the defendant was cross -examined about and accepted
having made a statement to the Police and identified his signature on a
photocopy of a statement shown to him, this statement was not tendered in
evidence.  It was therefore of not evidential value and this court cannot
base any decision on it.

Counsel for the plaintiff  had earlier submitted that the defendant's
contention that he had only borrowed Shs8,500,000/= and evidence by the
defendant and DW2 that the defendant had paid  Shs 15,000,000/= to the
plaintiff in full and final settlement of his claim were facts not raised
in the defendant's Written  Statement of defence.  He submitted that the
defendant is bound by  his pleadings and cited  Interfreight Forwarders (U)
Vs EA DB SCCA No 33 of 1993 (1993) IV KALR 124 where Oder JSC held that a
party  is expected to be bound to prove the case alleged by him and as
covered in the issues framed.  He will not be allowed to succeed on a case
not set up by him and be allowed at the trial to  change his case or set up
a case inconsistent  with what is alleged in the pleadings except by way of
amendment of the pleadings.  See also Nairobi City Council Vs Thabiti
Enterprises Ltd. (1995 - 1998) 2 EA 231 and Galaxy Paint Co Ltd Vs Falcon
Grounds Ltd (2000) EA 385.

The defendant in his Written Statement of defence only denied obtaining the
loan and denied issuing the cheque as his personal cheque but that of Akim
Construction Company Ltd a separate legal entity.  He never pleaded
settlement of the loan whether by himself or the company. The plaintiff was
neither cross-examined at all about any agreement allegedly reached on the
amount payable back nor about any payment allegedly made to him.  It was
only during the testimony of the defendant and DW2 that the alleged
payments surfaced.  The plaintiff was not at all given an opportunity to
say anything about the alleged payments.  There was no amendment of the
Written Statement of defence.  In the circumstances the defendant cannot be
allowed at the trial to change his case or set up a defence which is
inconsistent with what is alleged in his pleadings. The defendant could not
just wakeup in the course of his evidence and claim that despite his denial
of receipt of the loan, he had in fact settled the same, whether on his
account or that of the company.

In the event I am wrong in my holding above, was there payment! The law is
that where a party alleges that it paid the other and the other denies
receipt of the payment, the burden is on the party who alleges payment to
prove it.  It is the testimony of both the plaintiff and the defendant that
the cheque was only issued as security for payment of the loan sum.  The
plaintiff's evidence that the cheque was not paid is undisputed.  In fact
in his testimony the defendant states:-

       "When the date of the cheque came I told him (plaintiff) not to  bank
       it because I had told him there was no money on the bank account."
    And in cross-examination the  defendant  states  that  he  studied  the
    cheque and saw that it  had  been  presented  and  endorsed  "refer  to
    drawer."


   It is the defendant's testimony that the plaintiff was to hand  back  the
   cheque to him when the loan sum would have  been  paid.   Therefore,  the
   repossession of the  cheque  was  very  important  to  the  defendant  as
   evidence of payment of the loan sum in full.  It is surprising that  with
   that importance attached to the cheque he found it proper to  destroy  it
   immediately it was given back to him.  The  defendant  contends  that  he
   paid shs10, 000,000/= in cash and Shs5, 000,000/= by  yet  another  post-
   dated cheque.  There was no counterfeit of this  Shs5,  000,000/=  cheque
   tendered in evidence and there was no evidence to show that  this  cheque
   had been cashed.   Counsel  for  the  defendant  argued  that  since  the
   plaintiff had failed to tender in evidence the  Shs33,  030,000/=  cheque
   which had bounced that was evidence that he had been paid.  I must  point
   out that the cheque was merely security for payment.  And it having  been
   accepted by the defendant that actually it was not paid and as it was not
   the basis of the plaintiff's claim it was not  of  the  same   evidential
   value to the plaintiff's case as it was to the  defendant's  case,  whose
   payment is denied.  I therefore find that the  defendant  has  failed  to
   prove that the money advanced was paid back.




4th Issue whether the plaintiff is entitled to the remedies sought.

The plaintiff prayed for the sum of Shs33, 030,000/= and cost of the suit.
I have found that the defendant borrowed Shs33, 030,000/= from the
plaintiff.  Further that the defendant has failed to prove that he paid
back the said sum or any part thereof.  The plaintiff is entitled to be
paid back.  He is accordingly awarded the sum of shs33, 030,000/=

In normal circumstances costs follow the event.   So the plaintiff is also
awarded the costs of this suit.  Judgment is accordingly entered in favour
the plaintiff in the above terms.





                      Hon. Mr. Justice Lameck N. Mukasa
JUDGE
