                           Bagatenda Peter v Uganda                     The Supreme Court of Uganda at Mengo                 Supreme Court Criminal Appeal No. 10 of 2006                (Arising from Criminal Appeal No. 155 of 2001)                                    Before       Coram: Odoki CJ, Tsekooko, Mulenga, Kanyeihamba, Katureebe, JJ.SC                              October 16th, 2007  Evidence - Alibi - Defenses - Whether the defense of Insanity can be raised on appeal if not raised in the trial Court.   The appellant was convicted and sentenced to death by  the  High  Court  for murder contrary to S. 183 and S. 184 of the Penal Code Act.  His  appeal  to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. The facts  briefly  stated  that  on  the 19th July, 2000 at around 1 p.m, one  Pauline  Nassiwa,  the  deceased,  was walking home in the company of her nephew Byabasajja Bazira (PW2)  when  the appellant emerged from a bush, grabbed her and  cut  off  her  head  with  a panga and ran off with that head. The  appellant  was  arrested  nearly  two weeks later in another village to which he had relocated.  While  in  police custody, he directed the police to the locations where  he  had  hidden  the head of the deceased as well as the panga,  and  both  were  recovered  from those locations. However,  at  his  trial,  the  appellant  denied  that  he committed the offence and pleaded alibi, namely that at the time and day  of the offence he was not in the village.  Counsel for the appellant  submitted in this appeal that the appellant was insane at the time it was  alleged  he killed the deceased. The grounds of appeal relied on by the  appellant  were as follows;     i) The learned Justices of Court of Appeal  erred  in  law  and  fact  in       finding that the             Appellant was not suffering from mental disorder at the time  of commission             offence.   ii) The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal erred  in  law  when  they       failed to properly subject the evidence on record  to  fresh  scrutiny       and  evaluation  thereby  upholding  the  appellant's  conviction  and       sentence.  iii) That in the alternative but without prejudice to the  aforestated  the       appellant shall             in accordance with the principle of fair trial seek to  mitigate the mandatory death             sentence to custodial sentence  Held:     1. The trial judge correctly addressed the defense of alibi and the  law.       The appellant        would not  have  known  the  location  where  the       deceased's head was buried, or where the murder weapon was, unless  he       had committed the crime himself and hidden  them.  This  evidence  was       well corroborative of the evidence of PW2  and  effectively  negatived       the defense of alibi. The learned justices were right to find that the       learned trial judge had properly evaluated all the evidence on  record       and          come to the correct decision that the appellant was at  the  scene   of the crime and          committed the crime.    2) The defense of insanity was never raised by  the  appellant  or  anyone      else whether at the time of his arrest or at his trial. On the evidence      on record, there was no basis for the Court to consider the defense  of      insanity. It was never raised at the trial and  no  evidence  supported      it. The trial Judge could therefore not have misdirected herself  on  a      matter not in issue. Furthermore, the Appellant's Counsel both  in  the      Court of Appeal  and  in  the  Supreme  Court  did  not  seek  to  make      application to adduce fresh evidence as to the  mental  status  of  the      Appellant.  Appeal dismissed.  Confirmation of  sentence  postponed  until  determination  of  the  pending Constitutional Appeal against the decision of the  Constitutional  Court  in Constitutional Court Petition No. 6 of 2003 (Susan Kigula  &  417  Others  v Attorney General).
