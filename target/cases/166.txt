RULING:

This is an application  by  the   Inspectorate   of  Government  brought  by
Notice of Motion under Order 1 rules 10 (2) AND 13, Order 52 rules 1  and  3
of the Civil Procedure Rules and Section 98 of the Civil Procedure  Act  for
Orders that:-

The Inspectorate of Government be joined as a 2nd Defendant in the above
suit.
The costs of this application be in the cause.

The grounds for the application are that:-

The cause of action arose out of the investigations / findings/
recommendations/ directions of the Applicant and the interest of both the
Applicant and Justice shall be jeopardized without the presence and full
hearing of the Applicant.
 The joinder of the Inspectorate of Government as a 2nd defendant is
absolutely necessary in order to enable this Honourable Court to
effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions
involved in the main suit.
Joining the Applicant as a 2nd defendant shall not prejudice or curtail the
plaintiff's legal rights.

In the main suit the first Respondent, Blessed Constructions Ltd, is
claiming against the second Respondent, Jinja District Local Government,
for payment of shs93, 115,000/= for Construction work done on the 2nd
Respondent's instructions by the first Respondent in various schools under
the 2nd Respondent's administration and for general and exemplary damages
for breach of contract and costs of the suit.  In the plaint the first
Respondent claims that the value of the work completed at the various
school sites was in the region of shs93, 115,000/=.  That while the first
Respondent was proceeding with the work, it was instructed by the 2nd
Respondent to stop the work which the 1st Respondent contends was in breach
of the contract.  Thus the suit.

In the plaint it is further stated:-

      "9. The decision of the Defendant to stop the Plaintiff from  carrying
      out further works was  base  on  the  instructions  by  the  Inspector
      General of Government's Office (IGG) to the Defendant not to sign  any
      contract with the Plaintiff and the other companies involved.  Copy of
      the IGG's letter to the effect is attached hereto and marked Annexture
      "C".

      10. When the plaintiff was stopped, an investigation was  carried  out
      by the IGGS office which issued a  report  which  among  other  things
      established that part of the works  had actually been carried  out  by
      the Plaintiff but the report erroneously concluded that there  was  no
      contractual arrangement between the plaintiff and the Defendant.  Copy
      of the said report is attached hereto and marked Annexture "D"


This application is  supported  by  the  affidavit  deponed  to  by  Kwebiha
William ,  an  Inspectorate  Officer  at  the  Inspectorate  of  Government,
attached to Jinja Regional Office, where in he avers:-

"3.  That during the month of August 2003 the   Inspectorate  of  Government
    received a complaint alleging that whereas Jinja District Tender  Board
    advertised tenders inviting competent firms to apply and be  considered
    for  construction  works  for  the  years  2003/2004,  the   jobs   and
    construction work were irregularly given out.


That whereas the District Tender Board has never sat to award  the  tenders,
the Secretary to the Tender Board has issued fake award  letters,  with   no
Board Minute  to approve his actions, to the following companies:-


Blessed Construction Ltd
              ---
              ---
              ---
    That although the companies listed in Para 4 above had already  started
    construction work at various sites; no agreement had been  signed  with
    the District Authorities.


    That the Applicant  on commencing the   investigation  into  the  above
    allegations issued instruction to  the  Chief  Administrative   Officer
    (CAO) of Jinja District Local Government, not  to  sign  any  agreement
    with the companies  named  in  Para  4  above,  until  the  Applicant's
    investigations are completed  Attached is the said letter marked 'I'

--- the purported contract between the 1st and 2nd  Respondent  was  illegal
and therefore unenforceable"


The second Respondent filed an affidavit in reply  deponed to by  its  Chief
Administrative  Officer,  Eustance  G.  Gakwandi  where  he  avers  that  he
believes the  issues  in  the  main  suit  would  best  be  effectually  and
completely resolved if the Applicant is a party  as one of  the  defendants.
In otherwise    the 2nd Respondent did not oppose the application.

The first Respondent opposed the application.  It filed an affidavit
deponed to by its Managing Director Geoffrey Waswa where he stated that the
application is merely a complaint by the Applicant against the 2nd
Respondent for alleged irregularities by the 2nd Respondent in the course
of its activities, which alleged irregularities are a matter between the
second Respondent and the Applicant which would warrant an action between
the two.  Secondly, that the first Respondent's claim in the main suit is
based on breach by the 2nd Respondent of a contract to which the Applicant
is not privy.  Thirdly that the Applicant   can be called by the 2nd
Respondent as a witness in the main suit if it so wished or as a third
party if the 2nd Respondent is entitled to an indemnity or compensation
from the Applicant.

This application is brought under Order 1 rule 10 (2) of the Civil
Procedure Rules which provides:-

    "The  court may at any stage  of  the  proceedings   either   upon   or
    without the  application of either party, and on  such   terms  as  may
    appear to the Court to be just, order  that  the  names  of  any  party
    improperly  joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant  be  struck  out,
    and that the name of any   person  who  ought   to  have  been  joined,
    whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before  the  Court
    may  be  necessary  in  order  to  enable  the  Court  effectually  and
    completely to  adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the
    suit, be added."

Mr. Noah Sekabojja, Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted  that  Order  1
rule 10 (2) CPR does not cover a situation where a party  just  decides,  to
apply  to be joined as a party , most especially  where  he  applies  to  be
made a defendant when the plaintiff  has  no  claim  against  him.   Counsel
further argued that rule 4 would require an amendment of the plaint, in  the
event the application is allowed, whereby the plaint  so  amended  would  be
required to disclose a cause of action against the Applicant.  He  contended
that the 1st Respondent has no cause of action  against  the  applicant  who
was not privy to the contract between the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Mr. Vincent Kasujja, counsel for the Applicant, argued that the actions of
the 2nd Respondent which are the basis of the 1st Respondent's cause of
action against the 2nd Respondent were as a result of the Applicant's
findings and recommendations which the 1st Respondent cannot appropriately
answer.  He therefore argued that to fairly adjudicate upon the claim in
the main suit and avoid a multiplicity of suits it was necessary to add the
applicant as a party.  Counsel referred to Kololo Curing Co Ltd Vs West
Mengo Co-op Union Ltd (1891) HCB 60 where Justice Ntabgoba held that under
Order 1 rule 10 (2) of the Civil Procedure Rules not only can any of the
parties to a suit avail himself of the provisions of the rule but the court
itself can on its own motion join any party as plaintiff or as defendant if
in its judgment such joinder would enable court to effectually and
completely determine the suit.

In  Gokoldas Laximidas Tanna Vs  Sorter Rose  Munyinza H.C.C. S. No. 7076
of 1987 (1990 - 91) KALR 21  Justice Ouma stated:-

    "The law is that a person whose legal right  or  who  claims  that  his
    legal right will be directly affected by the  granting  of  the  relief
    claimed in the action and can therefore,  show  that  his  presence  is
    necessary to enable the court effectually and completely to  adjudicate
    as above stated, may be added to the suit  as  a  party  upon  his  own
    application (see the  case of Dollfus Mieg Vs  Bank of  England  (1951)
    Ch 33 and Amon Vs Raphael Truck and Sons Ltd (1956) 1 QB 357)"


The above sub rule empowers Court at any stage of the proceedings  to  order
that the name of any person  who  ought  to  have  been  joined  whether  as
plaintiff or defendant or whose presence before Court may  be  necessary  in
order to enable Court effectually and  completely  to  adjudicate  upon  and
settle all questions involved in the suit be added.  Such a  person  may  be
joined ever if the Plaintiff does not have a cause if  action  against  such
person provided that the party's presence is necessary in  order  to  enable
the  Court  effectually  and  completely  adjudicate  upon  and  settle  all
questions involved in the suit before it.  See DAPCB Vs. Jaffer Brother  Ltd
SCCA No. 9 of 1998, Aomor Rapheal Vs. Tuch & Sons Ltd [1956] 1 All ER 273.

In the instant case the applicant is moving court to exercise its
discretion on its own motion under the sub rule to order the Applicant to
be joined as a party on the ground that its findings and recommendations
are directly affected by granting the relief claimed by the 1st Respondent
against the 2nd Respondent.  This is born out in paragraphs 3 to 7 of its
affidavit in support of the application and paragraphs 9 and 10 of the
plaint,

The Inspectorate of Government is a creation of the Constitution under
Article 223 whose functions include promotion and fostering strict
adherence to the rule of law elimination of abuse of authority and of
public office, among others.  See Articles 225 and the Inspectorate of
Government Act, Act 5/2002 The Inspectorate of Government must own its
decisions and recommendations and is under a duty to defend those
decisions.  Mr. Sekabojja argued that the appropriate option was for either
the 2nd Respondent to join the Applicant as a third party or call the
Applicant's officials as witnesses.  Considering the fact that the 2nd
Respondent had acted on the recommendations of the Applicant it had the
said options open to it, if it so chose.  However, the 2nd Respondent had
not applied to join the Applicant as a third party.  It could choose to
call or not to call the Applicants Officials involved in the investigations
as witness.  A non - party to a suit cannot apply to be joined as a third
party.  Similarity a non-party to a suit cannot call himself as witness
where the party who would have reasonably called them chooses not to call
them.  The most appropriate course is for a party whose interest would be
directly affected by the decision to move Court to exercise its discretion
to add such party as a person whose presence before Court may be necessary
for the effective and complete adjudication upon and settlement of all the
issues before it.

However, when exercising its power under the above order Court must also
have in mind the issues of costs.  When a plaintiff loses a case against
any party he has sued in normal circumstances he is bound to shoulder the
costs incurred by that party.  Therefore a plaintiff cannot be forced to
sue somebody whom he has not chosen to sue.  See Edward Kabugo Sentongo Vs
Dr. George Asaba HCT-00-CC-MA-0238 of 2006, Denis Kimuli Bahemuha Vs Sarah
Bimbona Anywar & Anor (1987) HCB 71.

Under the sub-rule a person may be joined whether as plaintiff or defendant
or necessary person for the effective and complete adjudication of the
matter.  In Inspector General of Government Vs Kikonda Butema Farm Ltd and
AG C.A.  Constitutional Application  No 13 of 2006, the  IGG applied to be
permitted to  appear as Amicus Curiae (friend of the Court). According to
the Blacks Law Dictionary (7th Edn) that is a person who "is not a party to
a law suit but who petitions the Court to file a brief in the action
because that person has a strong interest in the subject matter "By virtue
of the Applicant's Constitutional and statutory functions in the
circumstances of this case I find the Applicant such a person in
circumstances of this case.

Considering the law and all the circumstances giving rise to the  2nd
Respondent's cause of action against the 1st Respondent I find that the
applicant is a necessary party for the effective and complete adjudication
of the issues in the main suit.

The Applicant has to become a party to the suit.   In the circumstances of
this case the Applicant cannot be joined as a plaintiff since its
interest's conflict with those of the plaintiff.  It cannot be joined as a
third party since no such application has been made in that respect by the
2nd Respondent who is the defendant.  The Applicants interest is more in
line or a kin to those of the defendant.  Therefore most logical action
would be to add the Applicant as a defendant coming in as a friend of
Court.


All in all this application is allowed.  The Applicant has been added as a
party upon its own interest to become a party therefore each party will
bear its own costs.



                      Hon. Mr. Justice Lameck N. Mukasa
Judge
