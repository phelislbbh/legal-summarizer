Editors Summary  The complainant was approached by two people at about 8:00 pm in September 1996 who wanted to hire  his taxi. Hiring charges were agreed on and the complainant drove the people to a hotel where two other  people joined them in the car. The complainant then drove towards the agreed destination. The  Appellants were among the four persons. Upon reaching the destination, the persons refused to alight  from the car. One of the passengers threw a rope around the complainants neck while the others hit him  with a hammer and a spanner. When the complainant tried to run away, he was hit again and he fell down  unconscious. The assailants then escaped with the car.  The complainant later regained consciousness and sought treatment. The vehicle was recovered the  following day in the First Appellants compound. All the Appellants were arrested at the home of the  First Appellant and charged with robbery. In their defence the Appellants stated that they had taken the  complainants vehicle pursuant to a sale agreement with the complainant. The High Court rejected the  Appellants story, accepted the prosecutions case convicted and sentenced the Appellants to death.  Page 532 of [2000] 2 EA 531 (CAK)  The Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal and the appeal was dismissed. They then appealed to  the Supreme Court on the grounds that there were material contradictions in the testimonies of the  prosecution witnesses, and that the court haderred in finding that violence had been used and that deadly  weapons had been used on the complainant.  Held  Minor contradictions not deliberately made in order to mislead the court did not prejudice the  Appellants case; Tajar v Uganda EAC number 167 of 1969 (UR) followed. Concerning hearsay  evidence, the trial court had relied on some other evidence which was not hearsay and the portion of the  evidence which was hearsay was severable from that shed upon by the court.  There was sufficient evidence to show that violence had been used on the complainant. The conduct  of the Appellants, including removing the number plates from the complainants vehicle was not  consistent with that of ordinary buyers but of robbers.  The evidence showed that the Appellants had used a hammer weighing 2 kilograms to assault the  complainant on the head, which was capable of causing death; Wasajja v Uganda [1975] EA 181 and  Birumba and another v Uganda (SC) criminal appeal number 32 of 1989 (UR) distinguished. The  weapon used by the Appellants, a hammer, was a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 273(2) of  the Penal Code.  Appeal dismissed.

The Appellants were convicted by the High Court sitting at Mbale of the offence of  aggravated robbery contrary to sections 272 and 273(2) of the Penal Code and were sentenced to death.  Subsequently, the Court of Appeal confirmed the conviction and the sentence, whereupon the  Appellants appealed to this Court. When the appeal came up, we heard counsel for Appellants, and  dismissed the appeal without hearing counsel for Respondent and reserved our reasons to be given later.  We now give the reasons.  The facts of the case are that on 6 September 1996 at about 8:00pm the complainant Nabeta Siraji  (PW1) was approached by two people who wanted to hire his taxi registration number 954 UBR to take  them to Nabumali. Hiring charges were agreed at Shs 7 000. After the two men entered the car, he drove  them to Palace Hotel in Mbale Town where he found Ali Wanyakala (A3) and another person. These two  joined them in the car. One of the two  Page 533 of [2000] 2 EA 531 (CAK)  men had a bag. Situma (A1) provided money for fuel. After fuelling the vehicle at Total Petrol Station,  the complainant drove them in accordance with the agreement to Nabumali Trading Centre. Instead of  the passengers getting out of the vehicle, they persuaded the driver to drive them further. After going for  some distance one of the occupants at the back threw a rope around the complainants neck while the  other passengers hit him with a hammer on the head. A struggle ensued. The complainant was able to get  rid of the rope and managed to get out of the car. He was hit with a hammer and a spanner used for  opening water pipes. When he tried to run away, he was hit again and fell down. After beating him and  leaving him for dead they made off with the vehicle.  He later regained consciousness and through difficulty got transport back to Mbale Town where he  was admitted at Mbale hospital for treatment.  On the following day the vehicle was recovered at Kawempe near Kampala in the compound of  Ramathan Situma (A1). All the three Appellants were arrested at the home of Ramathan Situma and later  they were transferred to Mbale where they were charged with the offence of robbery.  Their defence was that they had taken the vehicle with the complainants consent after he had agreed  to sell it to them at Shs 2 500 000. They said that they paid him Shs 500 000 and the balance of Shs 2  million was to be paid to him in Kampala. The Learned trial Judge rejected the Appellants story and  accepted the prosecution case, convicted them and sentenced them to death. Their appeal to the Court of  Appeal was dismissed on 24 November 1999 and hence this appeal.  The appeal to this Court was based on six grounds, namely:  1 T hat the Learned Justices of Appeal made an error of mixed law and fact when they held that the  inconsistencies in the testimonies of PW2 and PW4 were minor and had been rightly disregarded  by the trial Judge.  2 T he Learned Justices of Appeal made an error of mixed law and fact when they found that  violence was proved to have been used during the alleged theft.  3 T he Learned Justices of Appeal made an error of mixed law and fact when they upheld that deadly  weapons were used during the alleged theft, hence wrongly upholding the conviction of the  Appellants for capital robbery.  4 T he Learned Justices of Appeal erred in law when they found that the judgment of the lower court  was tainted/prejudiced by reliance of hearsay evidence and in so doing, wrongly upheld the said  judgment.  5 T he Learned Justices of Appeal made an error of mixed law and fact when they summarily rejected  the Appellants alternative prayer for conviction for simple robbery.  6 T he Learned Justices of Appeal made an error of mixed law and fact when they upheld the finding  of the trial Judge that the tests results tendered by the prosecution sufficiently corroborated the  allegation that the tools in question had been used to assault the complainant.  In arguing the appeal, Mr Tusasirwe who appeared for the Appellants argued grounds 1 and 4 together.  Ground 2 was argued separately whilst grounds 3, 5 and 6 were argued together.  Page 534 of [2000] 2 EA 531 (CAK)  The thrust of grounds 1 and 4 was that if the Court of Appeal had properly exercised its duty as first  appellate court and re-evaluated the evidence as required under Rule 29 of the Rules of the Court of  Appeal, 1996, the Justices of Appeal would have found that the inconsistencies in the evidence of Siraji  Nabeta (PW1) and deputy sergeant Muganga (PW4) were major. He contended that in view of those  inconsistencies and the hearsay evidence, it was wrong for the Court of Appeal to uphold the judgment of  the High Court.  On the issue of hearsay, the Court of Appeal held that it was true that the evidence relating to what  Lukiya Ssonko told PW2 and PW4 was hearsay. However, the Court of Appeal held rightly, in our view,  that since in reaching his decision the trial Judge relied on some other evidence which was not hearsay at  all, the portion of hearsay evidence was severable. In any case we do not accept the contention that  hearsay evidence occasioned any miscarriage of justice.  On the issue of contradictions in the evidence of Kiyingi Christopher (PW2) and deputy sergeant  Muganga (PW4) as to who recovered the exhibits from the house of Situma, the First Appellant, the  Court of Appeal addressed itself to the contradictions and found that these were minor and had not been  deliberately made in order to mislead the court. The Court of Appeal relied on the case of Tajar v  Uganda [1969] EACA number 167 of 1969 (UR) for the above proposition. We agree with the  conclusion of the Court of Appeal on the issue of contradictions. In any case, we do not see any  substance in the complaint concerning the contradictions since Situma (A1) admitted that the exhibits  were picked from his residence. In the result we found that grounds 1 and 4 must fail.  The issue of whether or not the Appellants used violence in taking the vehicle from the complainant  was clearly raised and considered by the trial court and the Court of Appeal. We agree with the findings  of both courts that if the complainant had sold the vehicle as claimed by the Appellants, they would not  have assaulted him, inflicting cut wounds on his head and abandoning him for dead at night in the bush  around Nabumali. The signs of struggle at the scene of the robbery as observed by William (PW5) during  the investigation of the case was evidence that the vehicle was not voluntarily handed to the Appellants  by the complainant. This evidence coupled with the absence of the number plates from the vehicle when  they parked it outside the First Appellants residence at Kawempe in Kampala was clear indication that  the Appellants could not have got the vehicle with the consent of the complainant.  Clearly, the conduct of the Appellants in the whole exercise was rightly construed by the two courts  below as not of ordinary buyers but of robbers. In the premises, we found that ground 2 must also fail.  We now turn to grounds 3, 5 and 6 which were argued together. The prosecution evidence which was  accepted by the trial court was that the Appellants assaulted the victim with a hammer which is used in  crushing stones and a spanner used by plumbers. The hammer was estimated to weigh about 2  kilogramms. In our view, the Learned trial Judge rightly held that if the hammer was used for offensive  purpose on the head of the victim, it was capable of causing the death of the victim. In our view, the case  of Wasajja v Uganda [1975] EA 181 is distinguishable from this case, because, in that case, the alleged  pistol used in the robbery had not been produced at the trial to  Page 535 of [2000] 2 EA 531 (CAK)  prove that it was a deadly weapon and secondly the pistol had not been fired in the course of the robbery  nor had it been fire tested to prove whether or not it could fire ammunition. There the finding of simple  robbery by the trial court was upheld. The case of Birumba and Another v Uganda (SC) criminal appeal  number 32 of 1989 (UR) is also distinguishable from the instant case, for similar reasons. The pistol  alleged to have been used in the robbery was not produced in court and was neither fired in the robbery  nor fire tested. The Supreme Court could not in the circumstances uphold the conviction for aggravated  robbery.  In the instant case, the weapon used was a hammer used in crushing stones. The issue was whether it  was a deadly weapon within the meaning of section 273(2) of the Penal Code. In our view, a hammer  weighing about 2 kilograms which was exhibited, when used for offensive purpose on the victims head,  was capable of smashing the victims skull, resulting in his death. We would not interfere with the  holding of the lower court on that issue. Consequently, we cannot fault the Court of Appeals finding that  the weapon used in the robbery was deadly. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the absence of  medical evidence on the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim of the robbery was immaterial, as  the victim of the robbery need not sustain injuries in the robbery. It is enough to show that the robbers  used or threatened to use a deadly weapon. In this case, there was ample evidence that the Appellants  used a deadly weapon in the process of taking the complainants vehicle. The Appellants alternative  prayer for a conviction of simple robbery was therefore unsustainable and was rightly rejected by the  Court of Appeal.  We think, however, that the criticism raised in ground six has substance. Clearly there was serious  omission on the part of the investigating officer who submitted blood samples and blood-stained exhibits  to the government chemist for analytical examination. He submitted the complainants blood samples  only but failed to submit the Appellants blood samples to rule out any possibility of the bloodstains on  the exhibits being those of any of the Appellants. We have to stress that if the prosecution had intended  to prove that the blood stains on the exhibits was the victims blood, it was necessary to submit to the  government chemist blood samples from both the victim and the suspects (Appellants) together with  blood-stained exhibits for analytical comparison. That way it would have been determined if the  bloodstains on the hammer were not those of any of the Appellants. As it happens this was not done with  the result that the evidence of the blood test results is not as weighty corroboration as it would otherwise  have been.  However, in our view, the omission to submit blood samples from the Appellants for analytical  examination by the government chemist did not weaken the prosecution case as there was overwhelming  evidence by PW1 that a hammer and a spanner were used by the Appellants to hit him on his head during  the robbery.  In the circumstances, we found no merit in the appeal and dismissed it.  For the Appellant:  Information not available  For the Respondent:  Information not available
