RONALD DE SMET::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
DEFENDANT



BEFORE:  THE HON. JUSTICE GEOFFREY KIRYABWIRE.

J U D G M E N T:

The plaintiff brought this suit against the defendant for  the  recovery  of
US$ 3,500 as rent  arrears  and  Shs.372,  696/=  being  utility  costs  for
electricity bills.

The case for the plaintiff is that the defendant entered into occupancy of
the plaintiff's premises situated at Plot 14 Erica Magala Road Entebbe
(hereinafter called "the house") without the consent of the plaintiff or
his letting agents M/s Alika Company Ltd.  It is alleged that the defendant
connived with an ex-employee of M/s Alika Company one Tom Ayeny to enter
into the house on paying him a monthly rent of US$450 instead of US$700 per
month.  Despite a notice of eviction and request to the defendant to
regularize his tenancy, the defendant left the house without paying rent or
the cost of utilities.

The defendant in his defence denies that he illegally occupied the said
house.  He pleads that he signed a tenancy agreement with the plaintiff's
letting agents, paid its operations manager Mr. Ayeny US$1000 as advance
rent and a further US$100 for which he obtained acknowledgements.  It is
also the case for the defendant that he effected repairs on the said house
which he allegedly agreed with the letting agent's operations manager would
be offset against any outstanding rent.  The defendant further pleads that
if there was a problem with the tenancy then by the plaintiff allowing him
to stay in the house for more than 3 months amounted to a rectification by
conduct.

At the scheduling conference the parties agreed to the following facts
that;
M/s Alika Co. Ltd was the property/letting agent in charge of the suit
premises.
There was a tenancy agreement executed and signed by the defendant and one
Tom Ayeny dated 15th December, 2003.
Tom Ayeny was an employee of Alika Co. Ltd at the material time.
The defendant paid US$1,100 to Tom Ayeny (The plaintiff later without
prejudice conceded this claim with a view to legally pursuing Tom Ayeny for
the said amount).
The defendant occupied the suit premises from 15th December 2003 up to June
2004.
There was a request dated 12th March, 2004 made by the defendant to Alika
Company, to extend the tenancy for three (3) months.
The defendant is willing to pay US$1,600 plus utility bills as per the
executed tenancy.

A protracted attempt to settle this case out of court failed and the matter
came to trial.  Judgment on admission was entered on the admitted sum of
US$1,600- for outstanding rent and Ug.Shs.372,969/= as utility costs.

The parties then agreed to the following issues for trial.
Whether there was a tenancy agreement between Alika Company Ltd on behalf
of the plaintiff and the defendant.
Whether payments were made to Alika Co. Ltd by the plaintiff.
Remedies available to the parties.

Mr. Daniel Rutiba appeared for the plaintiff while Mr. Joseph Kasozi
appeared for the defendant.  The defendant called no witnesses at the
trial.





Issues No. 1:    Whether there was a tenancy  agreement  between  Alika  Co.
                 Ltd on behalf of the plaintiff and the defendant?

It was admitted that the defendant and one Tom  Ayeny  an  employee  of  the
letting agent signed an agreement dated 15th December  2003  Exh.  P2.   The
said letting agent had the power to let the said house by virtue of a  power
of attorney made by the plaintiff dated 1st June 2000 Exh. P1.  Mr.  Godfrey
Kiggwe PW1 an Assistant Property Manager with Alika Co. Ltd  testified  that
he met with the defendant some time 2003 when the defendant was looking  for
a house to rent.  Mr. Kiggwe told the defendant that they  had  houses  with
rents ranging from US$500 - 1000.  They however failed to agree on any  rent
as the defendant wanted a cheaper house.  Mr. Kiggwe however testified  that
the defendant took possession of the said house and that he got to learn  of
that on the 24th December 2003.  Mr. Kiggwe  testified  that  the  defendant
entered into the said house after colluding with one of their employees  Tom
Ayeny and signing a tenancy agreement dated 15th December 2003  outside  the
known structures of the company.   Mr.  Kiggwe  further  testified  that  he
asked Mr. Ayeny to tell the defendant to leave the house  as  the  agreement
was illegal but Mr. Ayeny did nothing.  He testified that the defendant  all
along knew that the rent for  that  house  was  US$700  and  not  US$450  as
indicated in the said agreement.  Mr. Kiggwe testified that as a  result  of
this they through their lawyers on the 20th January 2004 wrote  an  eviction
letter to  the  defendant  and  threatened  him  with  arrest  for  criminal
trespass Exh. P5.

The tenancy agreement Exh. P2 provided in clause 2 for a rental period of 3
months from the 15th December, 2003 with an option to renew for a further
period subject to negotiations.  Clause 2 of the same agreement provided
for rent of US$450 for 3 months.

An attempt by the defendant's lawyers in Exh. P3 to extend the tenancy
after the initial 3 months was rejected by the lawyers of the letting
agents in Exb. P3.

Counsel for the plaintiff submitted
"...it is clear that the defendant legally occupied the rental premises for
only 3 months and continued illegally in the same for another 3 months..."

Counsel for the defendant chose not to submit on this, I suppose because no
tangible evidence was brought to rebut the allegation.

However, I find that the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff are some
what at variance with his pleadings and the evidence adduced.

The evidence before court is that the plaintiff does not agree that his
premises was at any time legally occupied by the defendant let alone 3
months.  The plaintiff considers the agreement illegal and signed without
authority.

On this point in the absence of any thing else, I am inclined to believe
the evidence of DW1 Mr. Kiggwe.  I think that is why a letter was written
to the defendant (through his lawyers) on the 20th January, 2004 Exh. P4
about one month after the agreement was entered evicting the defendant
(even though the defendant none the less continued to live in the house for
another 5 months).

To my mind the defendant must have known that his situation in the house
was not tenable but simply choose to ignore or contest this.  His lawyers
on the 12th March 2004 Exh. P3 wrote to the letting agents and stated;

      Our client  would  have  sought  force  longer  period  but  has  been
      discouraged by the conduct of Mrs. Okweyo Alice within this short stay
      to wit;


There was an attempt to unlawfully terminate the  contract  on  6th  January
2004.




The criminal summons of trespass that  were  commenced  against  our  client
were made in bad faith and misconceived as the  tenancy  was  subsisting  on
the date of complaint and therefore improper in law"
           (emphasis mine)

Whatever the sequence of events it is clear that  from  early  January  2004
less than a month after he entered the  house  attempts  were  made  by  the
letting agents to get him out.

I therefore find on the evidence that the tenancy agreement signed on the
15th December, 2003 Exh. P2 was not valid.  However, since the defendant
did occupy the house irrespective of that finding, I further find that this
created an "obligation quasi ex contractu"  a latin phrase that means a
quasi contract.  This quasi contract according to Osborn's Concise Law
Dictionary 6th Ed is
      "...an obligation not created by,  but  similar  to  that  created  by
      contract, and is independent of the consent of the person bound."


Issue No. 2:     Whether any payments were made to Alika Company Ltd by  the
             plaintiff.


It is an admitted fact that US$1,100 was received  by  Tom  Ayeny  from  the
defendant.  The issue now is whether that payment to Tom Ayeny  amounted  to
payment to Alika Company Ltd.  Clearly exhibits B1  and  B2  show  that  Tom
Ayeny acknowledged receipt of US$1,100 on hand written pieces of  paper  not
by the official receipts of the letting company.

The evidence therefore shows that the letting company did not receive this
money.  However, at the scheduling the plaintiffs generously conceded the
period 15th December 2003 to 14th March 2004 as money to persued from Tom
Ayeny at a different forum.

In light of the above concession I now find that no money was paid to the
plaintiff as rent for the subsequent period 15th March 2004 to 14th June
2004.



Issue No. 3:      Remedies

In light of my findings above it is clear that the defendant owed the
plaintiff rent as a result of a quasi contract/agreement at a rate of
US$700 per month and not US$450 per month under the invalid agreement.
With the greatest of respect to counsel for the defendant there is no
evidence that the plaintiffs at any stage of this transaction ratified the
rent of US$450.

I therefore accept the computation of the plaintiff as follows;

i)    December 15, 2003      - March 14, 2004      US$450 x 3 =
US$1,350
ii)   March 15m 2004 - June 14, 2004    US$700 x 3 =     US$2,100
iii)  Less many advance to Tom Ayeny               =     US$1,100
                                                         US$2,350

The sum due is US$2,350 for rent to be adjusted against the sum of US$1,600
where judgment was given on admission if it has been paid.  The sum of
Ug.Shs.372,969/= for utilities where judgment on admission was given is
also due if it has not already been paid.

This is a suit brought under summary procedure no claim was made for an
indeed argued for general damages save that it is be awarded in the
discretion of court.

Given the manner in which this tenancy was entered into I will in my
discretion award nominal damages of US$500.
I also award interest at the rate of 8% on the rental sum and utility costs
due from the date of filing of the suit until payment in full and further
interest of 8% on the nominal damages from the date of this judgment until
payment in full.
