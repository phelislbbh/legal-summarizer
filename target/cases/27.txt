JUSTICE RUBBY AWERI OPIO  J  U  D  G  M  E  N  T:-  The plaintiff brought this suit against the defendants  for  payment  of  US $14.400 or its equivalent in Uganda shillings as rent arrears,  special  and general damages, interest and costs of the  suit.   It  is  the  plaintiff's claim  that  by  tenancy  agreement  dated  8th  February  1999,  the  first defendant took on rent the plaintiff's premises on plot No.  6  Prince  Anne Drive, Bugolobi at a monthly rent of US $1.200 for one year expiring on  7th March 2000.  At the end of the tenancy the first defendant  did  not  vacate the premises nor inform the plaintiff  of  its  intention  not  to  continue renting the premises and the second defendant continued in occupation.   The defence on the other hand contended that there was a  tenancy  agreement between the plaintiff and the first defendant for  a  fixed  period  of  one year from 8th February 1999 to 7th March 2000 and rent for that  period  was fully paid.  The defence contended further that  after  the  expiry  of  the tenancy on the 7th March 2000  the  second  defendant  took  over  the  suit premises on the  basis  of  a  mutual  understanding  between  him  and  the plaintiff and the rent payable was to  be  US  $800  per  month.   That  the second defendant paid rent at the agreed rate until he was  evicted  by  the plaintiff in February 2001 when he was away in Nairobi on that  account  the defendants contended that the plaintiff has no cause of action. Issues for determination:  1) Whether the first defendant remained in occupation of the premises after     the expiry of the tenancy.  2) Whether the second defendant was a tenant of the plaintiff.  3) Whether the plaintiff  is  entitled  to  any  remedies  and  from  which     defendant. The  plaintiff  called  one  witness  Mr  Suresh  Mashru  (PW1)  while   the defendants never called any witnesses.  Suresh Mashru PW1 testified that the plaintiff was his  client.   He  stated that he has been doing business  of  property  management  in  Uganda  since 1987.  He sated that by powers of Attorney  (exhibit  P1)  he  was  the  one managing the plaintiff's property at Plot No.6 Princess Drive Bugolobi. In that capacity he knew  the  first  defendant  as  his  tenant  the  first defendant rented the said premises for the second defendant  who  was  their managing director from 8th march 1999 to 7th March 200 (exhibit P2).   Under that agreement the first defendant paid rent  for  the  period  between  8th March 1999 to 7th March 2000.  From 7th March to 24th October 2000  the  2nd defendant paid rent on behalf of the first defendant  (exhibit  P3).   Since it was the second defendant who was paying on behalf of first  defendant  he made receipts in his name.  After 24th October 2000 he  demanded  rent  from the second defendant who promised to pay after coming back from  Nairobi  in January 2001.  The second defendant failed to come back in  January  nor  in February 2001.  He decided to deploy  security  guard  to  ensure  that  the second defendant did not  leave  the  premises  without  clearing  the  rent arrears.  After waiting for so long he decided to write to second  defendant on 22/9/2000 demanding rent arrears US $4220 (exhibit P4).  He  received  no reply from the second defendant.  In mid October 2001 he decided  to  remove the defendants' property from the premises to  give  vacant  possession  for someone else to rent it.  He hired  a  store  and  shifted  the  defendant's property there.  He made an inventory of the property  in  the  presence  of chairman local council and his vice, secretary for defence,  security  guard labourers and a police officer among  others  (exhibit  P6).   He  took  the property to 6th street where he paid  a  monthly  rent  of  shs.454,000  per month for four months.  The property which he shifted belonged to first  and second defendants. Those which belonged to first  defendant  included  motor vehicles, toilet paper machinery set, and coffee processing machinery.   The rest were  personal  properties  of  second  defendant.   He  tendered  four receipts as evidence of payment of rent (exhibit P6).   He  stated  that  he incurred expenses in relocating the  defendants  property  in  the  form  of hiring fork lights and labourers (exhibit P7 and  P8).   He  incurred  other expenses in paying two guards to keep the properties (exhibit P9). Because the rent at 6th street was  very  high,  he  decided  to  shift  the properties to Plot 10 Clement Road where he was to  pay  rent  at  350,000/= per month.  Again he incurred expenses in  shifting  (exhibit  P10  andP11). The motor vehicles were parked at a different place on plot 15  Shimon  Road at a fee (exhibit P12). Lastly PW1 testified that he was entitled to  recover  the  money  which  he paid for water and electricity bills consumed by the defendants  which  were left unpaid exhibit P13 and P14).  He concluded  that  the  defendants  have never gone back to  reclaim  their  properties.   The  only  property  which reclaimed was he coffee  processing  plant  which  was  reclaimed  by  court bailiffs through a court order (exhibit P15). DETERMINATION: ISSUES: Issue No 1 whether  the  first  defendant  remained  in  occupation  of  the premises beyond the expiry of the tenancy. According to the evidence of Surish Mashru (PW1)  the  tenancy  between  the plaintiff and first defendant was for one year commencing on 8th March  1999 and ending on 7th March 2000 at the monthly rent of  US  $1.200  -  (exhibit P2).  After that period, the second defendant's  managing  director  continued  to occupy the suit  property.   PW1  testified  that  although  it  was  second defendant who was paying  rent,  he  was  paying  on  behalf  of  the  first defendant and in doing that  the  first  defendant  became  a  holding  over tenant.  According to Black's Law Dictionary a holdover tenant is  a  tenant who retains possession after expiration of a lease, or after  a  tenancy  at will has been terminated. In the instant case after  expiration  of  the  first  defendant's  tenancy, there is no evidence to show that the first defendant parted  possession  of the suit property.   Instead  there  is  uncontroverted  evidence  that  the second defendant for whom all  the  first  defendant  had  rented  the  suit premises continued to occupy the  same  and  was  paying  rent  as  per  the agreement.  The fact that he was paying rent in his own name  did  not  mean that he had taken  over  the  tenancy.   The  first  defendant  should  have informed the plaintiff that the second defendant in occupation  in  his  own right.  In the absence of that the  plaintiff  was  justified  in  believing that the first defendant was still in  occupation.   And  according  to  the inventory exhibit P   the first defendant never shifted  its  property  from the suit property.  In the above circumstances the only  fair  inference  to be drawn is that from the conduct of the first defendant it  can  be  safely implied that it remained in  occupation  of  the  suit  property  after  the expiry of the tenancy agreement. Issue No. 2:- Whether the second defendant was a tenant of the plaintiff. From what I have stated above, it is very clear that there  was  no  tenancy relationship  between  the  plaintiff  and  second  defendant.   The  second defendant was in occupation of the suit property  on  behalf  of  the  first defendant.  It was his official residence as  its  managing  director.   The first  defendant  has  failed  to  adduce  any  evidence  to  the  contrary. According to Section 102 of the Evidence Act he who alleges must  prove  it: See Paul Kawanga Ssemwogerere & Others  Vs Attorny  General,  Constitutional Petition No. 3/99.  It was upon  the  first  defendant  to  prove  that  the second defendant was in occupation as a new tenant.  In the absence of  such evidence, I would believe the plaintiff's witness that the  first  defendant remained in occupation after the expiration of the tenancy by retaining  the second defendant in the suit property.  The witness  was  emphatic  that  he never agreed on any other rental terms by reducing the  same  to  800$.   He insisted that had that been the case the receipts dated 14/6/2000,  3/7/2000 and 14/9/2000 would have indicated that new rate at  $800  per  month  which was not the case.  I do agree with that contention.   In  the  premises  the second issue is answered in the negative. Issue No. 3:- Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any remedies and from which  defendant.  It is trite law that a  lessee  who  holds  over  has  to  pay  rent:   See Christopher Sebuliba  Vs  Attorney General & Another,  Supreme  Court  Civil Appeal No. 13/91 (unreported).  In the instant case it was  first  defendant who was holding over tenant.  There was therefore no need  for  new  tenancy or re-negotiation of new terms.  The first defendant was  therefore   liable to continue paying rent under the expired tenancy  agreement.   See  Eastern Radio Service  Vs  Patel [1962] EA 818, 836 and 839. For reason the plaintiff is entitled to recover  from  the  first  defendant the rent arrears at US $14.400 as claimed which accumulated from  25/10/2000 to 13/10/2001 at a value of US $1.200 per month. On special damages, I find that the plaintiff  was  right  to  relocate  the defendant's properties to give him vacant  possession  for  another  tenant. But considering the fact that the tenancy agreement  provided  for  distress for rent, it was senseless for the plaintiff to relocate the  properties  to the second location on Clement  Road.   That  was  an  extravagant  decision which should not go without questioning.   Another  claim  which  should  be challenged is paying to Oketch John which was made on humanitarian  grounds.  In the interest of justice and fairplay, I  would  reduce  the  plaintiff's claim under that head to 6,000,000/= (six million shillings only). I would also award the plaintiff damages for  the  inconvenience  occasioned by the acts of the defendants.  The acts  of  the  defendants  had  put  the plaintiff in great anxiety.  In redress  of  the  same  I  would  award  the plaintiff shs.2,000,000/= (two million shillings only). Lastly the plaintiff claimed shs.500,000/= per month  from  18/12/2002  till renting for the defendants' principle is extinguished.  In of  what  I  have stated above such an award cannot be made. In conclusion judgment is entered for the  plaintiff  for  the  recovery  of rent arrears at US $14.400 or  its  equivalent  in  Uganda  shillings.   The plaintiff is entitled to six million and two million in special and  general damages respectively. The plaintiff is entitled to interest on rent arrears at 15% from  the  date of filing the suit until payment in full and also  on  special  and  general damages from the date of this judgment until payment in full. As to costs it is the first defendant to pay because  the  second  defendant was joined under Order 1 rule 7 of  the  Civil  Procedure  Rules  since  the plaintiff was in doubt as to which defendant he was entitled to  sue.   That rule is designed to prevent multiplicity of suits that would arise.  In  any case under section 27 of the Civil Procedure Rules Court has  discretion  to determine which party to pay costs. In the instant case the second defendant was the  first  defendant's  agent. It would therefore not be wise to condemn him to pay costs:  See D.T.  Dobie & Co.
