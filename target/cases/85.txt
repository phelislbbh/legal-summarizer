                             THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA  IN THE HIGH COURT OF UGAANDA AT KAMPALA (COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION)  HCT-00-CC-CS-0130-2002  CASEMENTS      (A)       LTD                   ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: PLAINTIFF                                     VERSUS  UGANDA DEVELOPMENT BANK     :::::::::::::::::::::::    DEFENDANT Textbooks: Chitty on Contracts, Volume 2 London Sweet & Maxwell 1999   BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE YOROKAMU BAMWINE  J U D G M E N T:  The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for payment of Shs.70, 068,027= for additional partition work; retention amounting to Shs.6, 296,435= and withholding tax receipt or value thereof amounting to Shs.2, 518,573=.  From the evidence, the plaintiff was invited by M/S Associated Architects, the defendant's Project Architects, to quote for the supply and erection of Aluminium Frame Partitions at Plot 22 Hannington Road, Kampala.  Pursuant to that invitation, the plaintiff forwarded a Quotation to the said Project Architect based on Elevation Drawings and Plans.  Later, the Architect wrote back to the plaintiff stating that the Quotation had been approved by the defendant for a total sum of Shs.125, 928,691=.  No formal contract was drawn up between the parties but the plaintiff went ahead and undertook the works based on the Quotation.  It is claimed by the plaintiff that whilst at work, it realized that the actual running metres exceeded the Quoted running meters of 255.75m.  That owing to the urgency of the work and with the consent of the Project Architect, it completed the works including the additions/variations and handed it to the defendant.  The plaintiff then demanded for Shs.78,883,039= being 5% retention, 4% withholding tax receipts and value of additional 153.33 running metres installed.  The defendant declined payment claiming that the contract was for a lump sum as opposed to a priced bill of quantities contract; and further, that the plaintiff was bound by the contract price.  Hence this suit.  At the scheduling conference held on 16/10/2002, the parties agreed: 1.    That the plaintiff was  contracted  to  do  the  partitioning  of  UDB       Towers for Shs.125, 928,691=. 2.    That the plaintiff handed over the work to the defendant. 3.    That the defendant accepted the work.  Issues were framed as follows: 1.    Whether or not the plaintiff did extra work. 2.    If so, whether the plaintiff is entitled to the payment sought. 3.    Any other remedies.  Representations: Mr. Muwema for the plaintiff. Dr. Byamugisha for the defendant.  Later in the proceedings, counsel for the  defendant  sought  to  amend  the issues to include: (i)   Whether there was an amendment to the contract by which the  plaintiff       was engaged to do extra work by the defendant for which the  claim  is       made. (ii)  Whether the principle of quantum meruit applies. (iii) Whether the contract was a lump sum contract and plaintiff is bound by contract price.  From the record of the proceedings, there is no  evidence  that  the  prayer was objected to by counsel for  the  plaintiff  or  granted  by  Court.   It appears to me to have remained a proposal.  Learned counsel for the  defence has based his submissions on the issues as framed on 16/10/2002.  I will  do the same.  I hope, in the process,  to  address  the  sub-issues  raised  by defence counsel's proposed amendment as well.  As whether or not the plaintiff did extra-work, I have considered the evidence of the parties on the matter.  PW1 Mr. Abid Alam, the Managing Director of the plaintiff company stated that the original work quoted for was 255.75 running metres and that the actual work carried out was 409.08 running metres, implying an additional 153.33 running metres to the original amount that was quoted for.  The evidence of PW2 Philip Fernandes, Technical Sales Manager at the time is to the same effect.  I have also addressed my mind to the evidence of PW3 Peter Kamya.  He was the defendant's Project Architect.  In a letter he wrote to his principal, the defendant herein, on 20/7/99, Mr. Kamya stated:        "Re: ADDITIONAL SUPPLY AND INSTALLATION OF OFFICE PARTITIONS AT  UDB        BY M/S CASEMENTS (A) LTD This is to refer to our discussions regarding the installation of additional partitioning carried out by M/S Casements (A) Ltd at UDB Towers.  The total running metres as per their original quotation Ref: CAL/AA/96/951, dated 19/10/96, based on elevations only was 255.75 at total value of Shs.125,928,691= (in words) whereas the total running metres actually installed as per plans was 409.08 at total value of Shs.195,996,722 (in words) reflecting a difference of Ug. Shs.70, 068,031= (in words).         In view of this, it is your prerogative to settle the claim of  this        contractor.  However  we  still  maintain  that  the  contractor  be        penalized for his negligence by deducting 10 - 15% from  the  amount        due to him.  We hope this will now put this matter to rest   Yours sincerely Arc. P. Kamya."  While testifying as a witness for the plaintiff, Mr. Kamya did  indicate  to Court that he could not  say  whether  the  plaintiffs  did  any  additional works.  That he would need documents  on  the  matter.   He  attributed  his indecisiveness to lapse of memory, it being long since  all  this  happened. I must say he had a point here, given that he was  testifying  close  to  10 years after the event.  Later, after the documents had been availed to  him, he conceded that going by the documents he had seen,  some  variations  were effected.  Commenting specifically on D. Exh. 11, the letter already set out above, the Architect said:       "I was saying in short that the contractor didn't have  a  contractual       claim for the additional works.  However, the  client  would  exercise       its prerogative and pay them for what they were claiming but  penalize       them for some negligence which we indicated in the letter.  I  confirm       that additional works were done.  UDB took possession of the completed       work and benefited from it."  In law a fact is said to be proved when Court is satisfied as to its  truth.  In the instant suit, the plaintiffs have alleged that some additional  work was done.  Their evidence is supported by  that  of  PW3  Peter  Kamya,  the defendant's own Architect.  An Architect  is  generally  the  agent  of  the principal for purposes of superintending project  works.   I  have  seen  no reason to  doubt  the  sufficiently  documented  additional  153.33  running metres to the original contractual measurements.   In  these  circumstances, Court is unable to accept  Dr.  Byamugisha's  argument  that  no  additional works were done.   On  the  balance  of  probabilities,  the  plaintiff  did additional work as claimed.  I so find and answer the  first  issue  in  the affirmative.  As to whether the plaintiff is entitled to the payment sought, I have also addressed my mind to the able arguments of both counsel on the matter. I have already noted that the plaintiff was invited by M/S Associated Architects to quote for the supply and erection of the Aluminium frame partitions.  The Quotations for the works were invited from a number of contractors.  They quoted as follows: (a)   Casements (A) Ltd - Shs.125, 928,691=. (b)   Lags Construction - Shs.127, 125,705= (c)   Jay Interiors Ltd - Shs.211, 044,600=.  After negotiations between the plaintiff and the project architect, the contract was awarded to the plaintiff at the sum of Shs.125, 928,691= inclusive of VAT.  Asked why the plaintiff was now asking for payment outside the contract price, the plaintiffs witnesses said that they made a mistake in their quotation.  Asked what mistake it was, PW2 said:       "The mistake that was made was, we made the quotation according to the       elevation drawings submitted by the Architect.   We  did  not  compare       them with  the  plan  drawings  submitted  by  the  Architect  because       normally both these drawings should give us the same details  for  the       job to be done.  To elaborate further if there is a partitioning to be       done there are two views.  One view is taken  from  the  top  that  is       called plan and the other view is from  front  side  which  is  called       elevation view.  And both these views should ideally reflect the  same       partition."  The defendant's Architect did not have kind words for the plaintiff's claim.  He stated in his letter of 17/12/98, D. Exh. X1:  "........................................................................... .     Your  claim  for  additional  partitioning  amounting  to  Ug.  Shs.70,     068,027= is  therefore  without  foundation.   We  suspect  this  is  a     surreptitious attempt on your part to revise  your  quotation  up-wards     under the guise of additional partitioning.       Your statement that you based you quotations on elevations alone cannot     be justified.  One would wonder how a contractor of  your  caliber  and     experience could base your quotation on elevations alone when you  know     very well that it is the plans which define the  extent  of  work  more     fully and that the elevations complement the plans and  not  the  other     way round.      If this claim were to be allowed, your quotation would no longer be the lowest and would give you unfair advantage over your competitors.       As for ...................................................."  Asked whether he, the Architect, ever objected to the additional  works,  he was categorical that he could not  have  objected  to  the  additional  work because he had not been made aware of it before  it  was  done.    There  is nothing in writing to suggest that either the  Architect  or  the  defendant was consulted before the additional works were done.  The Architect's evidence is that by the time he was made aware that there was additional work to be paid for; it (the work) had already been done.  I noted Mr. Kamya's demeanour as he testified.  He was calm and confident. In my view, his evidence that he was never consulted before the additional works were done is unassailable.  I accept the defence version and reject the plaintiff's.  And herein lies the plaintiff's fate.  Quotations for the works were invited from a number of contractors.  The defendant opted for the cheapest bidder, the plaintiff.  I would assume that the bid was based on past experience in the same field.  In a letter dated 7/11/1996, the defendant, through its agent, the Architect stated, interalia:     "4.  Tender figure Your tender figure is to remain unaltered."  The plaintiff accepted  that  condition.   Its  officials  have  now  turned around to say that they  mistakenly  based  their  quotation  on  elevation, instead of basing it on the drawings.  Who then should they blame for  their carelessness?  In my view, they have themselves to  blame  for  that  costly mistake.  From the records, this was a lump sum contract.  It is fitting that I should refer to the relevant passages in Chitty on Contracts, Volume 2 London Sweet & Maxwell 1999 para 37 - 008.  He states:       "Lump sum contract.   In  a  lump  sum  contract,  the  contractor  is       required to carry out and complete the entirety of the named  contract       works for a fixed sum agreed in advance, or,  as  is  more  usual,  if       there are changes in the  scope  of  the  named  contract  works,  for       "........ such other sum as shall  become  payable  .........  at  the       times and in the manner specified in the conditions."  In the case  of       lump sum contracts, the proposed contract works will  be  of  a  known       extent (that is, not at the development/design stage) and described in       the specification or Bill of Quantities.  Where the  specification  or       Bill of Quantities forms part of the contract, provided  the  work  is       sufficiently described, the contractor will be taken to have  included       for that work in his fixed price.   Where  work  is  not  sufficiently       described, and its existence is not reasonably to be inferred from the       language of the contract, the contractor will be entitled  to  recover       payment in addition to the fixed price."  From the above passage, it is clear to me  that  the  plaintiff  is  at  the wrong end of the law.  The work was sufficiently described  to  them.   They must be taken to have included the works claimed for herein in  their  fixed price of Shs.125, 928,691=.  In my view, a contract  can  only  be  made  on account of a mistake if the mistake was due to the ambiguity of  the  terms; or, if special circumstances exist to  render  the  mistake  excusable;  or, where the defendant must have  known  of  the  plaintiff's  mistake  at  the execution of the contract.  It would appear to me that none of  the  factors above is available to the plaintiff.   I would consider a  lumpsum  contract to be one  where  the  client  essentially  assigns  all  the  risk  to  the contractor, who in turn can be expected to ask  for  a  higher  mark  up  in order to take care of unforeseen contingencies.  As PW3 Kamya correctly stated, in my view, doing additional work in construction contracts is not uncommon.  However, if the actual cost of the project is under estimated, the under estimated cost will in my fair judgment ordinarily reduce the contractor's profit by that amount.  An over estimate would be to his advantage.  In the instant case, the mistake relied on by the plaintiff was merely the result of its own carelessness. The plaintiff cannot avoid performance of the contract by merely pleading mistake.  It also follows in my view that they cannot recover anything beyond the contract price as long as when they discovered the mistake, they did not have the courtesy of seeking the defendant's approval of any additional work before it was done.  It is settled law that where the contract is in writing, its terms can be ascertained by means of documentary evidence.  Where these are clear, as herein, a Court must give effect to the terms.  It is not the duty of the Court to re-write an expressly stated contract for the parties.  This is not to say, of course, that a contract once written cannot be varied.  It can be varied but with the concurrence of the other party.  In the instant case, the parties agreed that the tender figure would remain unaltered.  The plaintiff claims that the issue of additional works was discussed with the defendant's Architect.  PW3 Kamya denies it.  In view of this Court's finding earlier on in this judgment that the Architect was never consulted before the additional works were done, the plaintiff has no valid contractual claim against the defendant for the additional work.  The defendant's refusal to exercise its prerogative to pay for work it did not sanction cannot in the circumstances be faulted.  The plaintiff's claim must therefore fail and it fails.  As to any other remedies available to the plaintiff, there is evidence that it was paid in accordance with certificates issued by the Project Architect.  In D. Exh. X, the Architect told the plaintiff that the defendant did not hold any other certificate for the work they had done apart from the retention fee of Shs.2,435,920= which would be released to them after attending to all defects and uncompleted works.  He also rejected the claim for taxes.  In my view, he was entitled to do so.  Given that close to ten years later no defects or uncompleted works have been alleged against the plaintiff, Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to have the Shs.2,435,920= released to them.  This sum is accordingly decreed to the plaintiff.  As regards costs, the usual result is that the loser pays the winner's costs.  This practice is subject to the Court's discretion, so that a winning party may not necessarily be awarded his costs.  Taking into account the peculiarities of this case and the benefits derived by the defendant from the contract, the commercial justice of the case warrants that an order be made that each party bears its own costs.  I so order.  Yorokamu Bamwine J U D G E 25/05/2007  Order:  This judgment shall be delivered by the Registrar on my behalf on the due date.
