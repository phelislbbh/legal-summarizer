                           IN THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA IN THE HIGH COURT O F KAMPALA COMMERCIAL COURT DIVISION                              HCT-00-CC-CS-0448-2002  ATACO FREIGHT SERVICES LTD...... ...................... PLAINTIFF                                     VERSUS  LANEX FOREX BUREAU LTD AND ANOR ........... DEFENDANTS                         BEFORE: JUSTICE LAMECK N. MUKASA  RULING:  When this suit was called before me for hearing Mr. Dennis  Wamala,  Counsel for the 2nd defendant, Bank of Baroda  (U)  Limited,  raised  a  preliminary objection that by a compromise between the plaintiff and the  2nd  defendant recorded by this Court on 6th July  2004  the  plaintiff  withdrew  all  its claims against the 2nd defendant arising out of this suit.  On 6th July 2004 Mr Francis Wazarwaki Bwengye, Counsel for the plaintiff addressed Court in the following words:-       "Plaintiff and 2nd defendant have come to some compromise. The terms of     the compromise are as follows:-   Plaintiff be given a further period of ten months from the date of the            compromise within which to settle its obligation with the bank.     Interest accruing on the plaintiff's loan with the bank from 12th           November 2002 to 12th April 2003 be waived by the bank.     Suit against the 2nd defendant be withdrawn with no order as to costs."  The court made the following order:-      "Suit against the 2nd defendant is hereby withdrawn in the terms of the     above compromise."  Order 25 rule 6  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Rules  on  compromise  of  suits provides:-      "Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that  a  suit  has     been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or  compromise,     or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the wholly     or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the  court  may  on  the     application of a party, order the agreement, compromise or satisfaction     to be recorded, and pass a decree in  accordance  with  the  agreement,     compromise or satisfaction so far as it relates to the suit."  Apparently that is what happened and on 24th September  2004  the  plaintiff filed an amended plaint where the 2nd defendant did not future as  a  party. Thereafter the suit proceeded without the  2nd  defendant  until  11th  July 2006 when by consent  of  both  counsels  for  the  Plaintiff  and  the  1st defendant in Miscellaneous Application No 453 of  2006  this  court  granted the plaintiff leave to add Bank of Baroda (U) Ltd, as a  defendant  to  this suit.  On 28th July  2006 the  plaintiff filed yet  another  amended  plaint re-introducing Bank of Baroda (U) Ltd as a 2nd defendant.  It is the contention of Counsel for the 2nd defendant that consideration had been furnished by the 2nd defendant for the withdraw.  Further that the plaintiff had in its letter dated 31st January 2006   confirmed that there was no pending claim against the 2nd defendant.   Counsel prayed that in the interest of justice the 2nd defendant be discharged.  In reply Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the cause of action against the 2nd defendant in the Amended Plaint was different from the cause of action in the original plaint.  He contended that it was the claim as per the cause of action in the original plaint which had been withdrawn under the compromise.   Further that a withdraw of a suit does not act as resjudicata as judgement is not based on the merits of the case.  As of 6th July 2004, the date when the compromise was recorded, the plaint on record was the Amended plaint filed on 12the November 2002.  In that plaint the plaintiff was, in paragraph 3 thereof seeking to recover US$15,060 29 from the 2nd Defendant, general damages and costs of the suit.  In paragraph 4 vi the plaintiff states:-      "(VI) Further, between 26th March 2001 and 24th December 2001  the  2nd     Defendant acting on forged authority letters paid sums of money to  one     Chris Kille amounting to US$ 15.060.   Copies  of  the  said  authority     letters are attached and marked annextures B1 - B19"  The plaintiff goes on to  list  the  particulars  of  the  forged  authority letters and the  particulars  of  negligence  by  the  2nd  defendant.   The particulars of the 2nd defendant's negligence were listed as:     "(i) Issuing money on forged cheques and authority letters with  forged           signatures.                Failing to identify that letters in the forged signature  are          more distinct in comparison to the original signature.           Failing to maintain the duty of care between a Bank and a                       Customer.        (iv)    Failing to record one order for 4th June 2002 for US $1581, 18"  Then in paragraphs 5 and 6 it is claimed:-      "5 In the alternative the plaintiff shall aver that the defendants were     fraudulent and negligent respectively res ipsa loquitor.       As a result of the said forgeries and negligence by the defendants  the        plaintiff has suffered inconvenience, loss and damage for  which  it        holds the defendants liable"      The plaintiff's prayers as against the 2nd defendant were:       "(b) US$ 15,060.29 from the  2nd  defendant  being  the  sum  of  money     negligently paid on the forged authority letters. (c) Interest at Bank rate from date of filing the suit. (d) General damages for inconveniences and negligence against the 1st and 2nd defendants respectively. (e) Costs of the suit (f) Further or other relief.  It  is  these  claims  which  were  withdrawn  under  the  compromise.   The plaintiff's claim against the 1st defendant was for shs33, 858, 275/=  which the plaintiff contends is the sum of money the 1st defendant wrongfully  and fraudulently obtained from the plaintiff's account with the 2nd defendant.  In the Amended Plaint filed on 28th July 2006 the plaintiff's claim against the 1st defendant is substantially the same as in the amended plaint which had been filed on 12th November 2002.  As regards the 2nd defendants the plaintiffs claim is stated as follows:-      "7The plaintiff shall aver that the 2nd Defendant acted negligently  in     failing to detect the  forged  cheques  presented  to  it  by  the  1st     defendant without complying with the mandate the plaintiff gave to  the     2nd Defendant Bank regarding withdraws of monies from the account.  Particulars of negligence  Paying out money from the plaintiff's Account on forged cheques Failing to identify that letters in the forged signatures were more distinct on comparison with the original mandated signatures. Failure to maintain the duty of care between a Banker and a customer.   As a result of the said theft of the plaintiff's cheques, forgeries  of  the same and illegally withdrawing UGS 33.858,275/= from the plaintiffs  Account and  the  2nd  Defendants  negligence  by  paying  out  monies  to  the  1st Defendant without the Plaintiff's authorisation, the plaintiff has  suffered damages, financial loss and inconveniences for which the plaintiff hold  the defendants liable."       The prayers against the Defendants are for:-   The sum of UGS 33,858,275/= wrongfully and illegally obtained by the           1st Defendant from the plaintiff's Account in the 2nd Defendant's  Bank          which the Bank negligently paid out.       General damages for financial loss and inconvenience.   Interest on the decretal sum at Bank rate from the date of filing the suit             till judgement.       Interest on the decretal sum at Court rate from the  date  of  judgment     till           payment in full.       Costs of the suit   (f)     Further or other relief."  I have carefully studied both Amended Plaints and I find that  in  both  the plaintiff has a  claim  for  general  damages  against  the   2nd  defendant arising from the illegal  2nd   defendants  negligence  by  paying  out  shs 33,858,275/= to the  1st  Defendant from the  plaintiffs  account  with  the 2nd defendant  on  forged  cheques.   I  agree  with  Counsel  for  the  2nd defendant that this was one of the claims  withdrawn  under  the  compromise but which is re-introduced by the new Amended Plaint.  However, I also agree with counsel for the plaintiff that in the Amended Plaint filed on 12th November 2002 and the subject of the compromise there was no specific claim against the 2nd defendant for the sum shs 33.858,275/=.  This claim is introduced in the Amended Plaint filed on 28th July 2006 which reintroduced the 2nd defendant as a party.  It is therefore a fresh claim, not covered by the compromise.  The issue is whether a withdraw of a suit is a bar to the institution of a similar suit between the same parties, obviously subject to the periods of limitation.  A withdraw of a suit is not a judgement.  Section 7 of the Civil Procedure Act provides:-      "No court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly  and     substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue  in     a former suit between the same parties  or  between  the  same  parties     under which they or any of them claim litigation under the  same  title     in a court competent to try the subsequent suit or the  suit  in  which     the issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and  finally     decided by that court"  That is the plea of rejudicata and the important words in the section are "- -- the issue has been subsequently raised and has been  heard  and  finally, decided by that Court."  Fundamentally this doctrine is to the  effect  that there must be an end to litigation.  In determining whether or not a suit is barred by res judicata, the test is whether the plaintiff in the second suit is trying to bring before the court in another way in the form of a new cause of action a transaction which has already been presented before a court of competent jurisdiction in earlier proceedings and which has been adjudicated upon.   If this is answered affirmatively, the plea of resjudicata will then not only apply to all issues upon which the first court was called upon to adjudicate but also to every issue which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which might have been raised at the time, through the exercise of due diligence by parties - See Kamunye & Others Vs the General Assurance Society (1971) EA 263  Applying the above to the instant case I find that the claim against the 2nd Defendant for Shs33, 858,275/= raised in the Amended Plaint filed on 28th July 2006 is a claim which with due diligence would have been raised in the Amended Plaint filed on 12th November 2002.  If this suit had been heard on merit on the basis of the Amended Plaint filed on 12th November 2002 and finally decided by this court and later a new suit is filed on basis of the Amended Plaint filed on 28th July 2006, I would have found that suit is barred by res judicata.  In the instant case there is no fresh suit filed but an amendment of the plaint in the same suit.  As I have already held the claim against the 2nd defendant for Shs33,858,275/= raised in the Amended Plaint filed on 28th July 2006 is a claim which would have been raised in the Amended Plaint filed on 12th November 2002.  By the date the compromise was recorded the issues raised by the plaintiff against the  2nd defendant in the Amended Plaint filed on 12th November 2002 had not yet been heard and finally decided by this Court.  Therefore they were not yet barred by res judicata.  A withdraw of the suit is not a judgment on the merits of the case. Therefore the plaintiff was not barred from filing a fresh suit on substantially similar facts and issues.  To have proceeded by amendment of the plaint in the same suit was the most appropriate to avoid a multiplicity of suits.  In the final result the preliminary objection is rejected and dismissed with costs.                           Hon. Mr. Justice Lameck N. Mukasa JUDGE 20th April 2007                PAGE   PAGE  2
