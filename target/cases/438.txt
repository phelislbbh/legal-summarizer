BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE F.M.S. EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The applicant is the defendant in the head suit. It is seeking that a
judgment entered in default against it on the 18th August 2006 be set
aside, and that the applicant be granted leave to defend the suit on its
merits. In effect the ground for this application, as can be gathered in
the many grounds stated in the notice of motion is simply that the
applicant has a good defence to the plaintiff's claim. The application is
supported by an affidavit sworn by Sasi Nair, the Country Manager of the
Applicant. A supplementary affidavit, sworn by Assumpta Kemigisha, an
advocate working with the applicant's advocates was also, albeit, without
leave of court, filed in this matter.
The respondent/plaintiff opposes this application, and an affidavit in
reply to the application, sworn by Ashok M Joshi, a director of the
respondent was filed in this regard.
Mr. Kabagambe, learned counsel for the applicant, submitted that the
applicant was not at fault, but the fault lay with the counsel, that failed
to file the written statement of defence in time. This applicant should
therefore be allowed an opportunity to defend this suit.
Mr. Kibaya, learned counsel for the respondent opposed this application. He
attacked the filing of the supplementary affidavit by the applicant, as it
was done without leave of this court. He argued that this court should not
have regard to it. And if the court had no regard to it, there is nothing
before the court that explains why the applicant failed to file the defence
in time. Secondly he submitted that the applicant was under an obligation
to show that it had a defence worth being called a defence. In the instant
case the email message referred to in the affidavit of the applicant as
instructing it not to deliver the goods, was in fact, instructing them to
deliver the goods.
Lastly Mr. Kibaya submitted that setting aside the judgment in this case
would be prejudicial to the respondent due to the delay that would be
visited on these proceedings.
I shall start by bringing the applicable rule here in view. Order 9 Rule 12
of the Civil Procedure Rules, (Chapter 71, 2000 Rev Ed), states,
           'Where judgment has been passed pursuant to any of the preceding
           rules of this Order, or where judgment has been entered by the
           Registrar in cases under Order L of these Rules, the court may
           set aside or vary the judgment upon such terms as may be just.'
This rule obviously provides wide discretion to this court in applications
of this nature. I shall examine how this provision has been interpreted and
applied in the past. In Ooka v Phillister Nabunjo H.C.C.S.No. 613 of 1963
(unreported), Russel, J., held that where a defendant had appeared, but not
filed a statement of defence, and had a good defence on the merits, unless
he was simply trying to delay the action, the court should normally
exercise its discretion and let him put forward a defence, but penalise him
severely by way of costs.
In Sebei District Administration v Samwiri Gasyali and Others, 1968 E A
300, the respondent sued the appellant and others for damages for assault
and trespass. The appellant did not enter an appearance after it was served
with summons. Judgment against it was obtained in default. The respondent
applied for execution on 8th December 1967, and on the 18th December 1967,
the appellant applied to set aside the ex parte judgment. The magistrate
hearing the application dismissed it, and leave to appeal was granted to
the appellants, and the appellants were also ordered to deposit the
decretal amount in court, which they did.
On appeal to the High Court, Sheridan, J., stated at page 301,
           'It is not disputed that the appellants have a defence on the
           merits of the case. Nor does it appear that they have been
           trying to obstruct or delay the course of justice. As soon as
           they became aware of the judgment by the application for
           execution, they took steps to rectify the position. And, as I
           have already observed, they have paid the decretal amount into
           court. In these circumstances, the justice of the case required
           that the defence to be heard on its merits:'
Sheridan, J., in the above case referred to the case of Jamnadas V. Sodha v
Gordhahandas Hemraj, (1952), 7 U.L.R. 11, where Ainely, J., (as he then
was), stated,
           'Though I have the greatest sympathy with a busy magistrate who
           no doubt has a great deal to put up with in the way of belated
           applications and requests for adjournments, and though two views
           can no doubt be taken of this matter, I yet think that
           insufficient attention was paid by the lower court to the fact
           the appellant had a defence to put forward, and to the fact that
           no great hardship would have been likely to result to the
           respondent if an appropriate order for costs had been made. I
           may be doing the learned magistrate an injustice, but from a
           reading of his ruling of June 19 it seems to me that he has
           concentrated solely upon the poverty of the appellant's excuse.

                               In my view that is not the sole matter which
           must be considered in cases of this kind. The nature of the
           action should be considered, the defence if one has been brought
           to the notice of the court, however irregularly, should be
           considered, the question as to whether the plaintiff can
           reasonably be compensated by costs for any delay occasioned
           should be considered, and finally I think it should be always be
           remembered that to deny the subject a hearing should be the last
           resort of a court. Though I realise that the views expressed may
           not be shared by everyone I think that there was not a full
           judicial exercise of discretion in this case, and that it was
           wrong under all the circumstances to shout out the defendant. He
           should I consider have been visited with a severe order as to
           costs, and permitted to defend.'
It is clear from the foregoing authorities that a number of considerations
are apposite in proceedings of this nature. And that such considerations
ought to be taken together. These include whether the defendant has a good
defence or not. The question of delay or promptness in coming to court is
relevant. Whether an application is made in good faith or is an attempt to
obstruct the wheels of justice may be considered if it arises. The
prejudice that may be suffered by the plaintiff should also be considered.
And whether or not such prejudice may be compensated by an order for costs.
Running through all the above cases, is the showing of a good defence on
the merits.
Turning to the facts in our case, it is clear that the applicant has acted
promptly in coming to this court. This application was filed on 1st
September 2006 when the ex parte judgment in default was entered on 18th
August 2006. It may be noted that the applicant was out of time in filing
its defence by about a week only. The defence in this case ought to have
been filed before 3rd August 2006. It was filed on 11th August 2006.
Turning to the merits of the defence, the claim was for value of goods
imported by the plaintiff to Uganda, and loss of profits on that
consignment. It was contended that the defendant was instructed to clear
and forward the said consignment of goods to Kampala, and that the
plaintiff had paid all dues including freight and the defendant's charges
to the defendant. The defendant failed to clear and deliver the goods to
the plaintiff in Kampala.
The defendant contends both on the affidavit and the proposed written
statement of defence that the plaintiff had no claim on the applicant as
stated, in part, in paragraph 7 of the affidavit of Sasi Nair, below,
           'it was the late director of the Respondent Company who
           requested our Company to hold the containers in Mombasa as owing
           to financial constraints, he was not in a position to arrange
           freight charges and other dues. (A copy of an email to that
           effect is annexed hereto and marked, ''B''.'
The annexture B referred to reads,
           'Dear Sasi Nair Ji,
                                  Good Day!!!
                                                          Hope you are
           fine.
                          Reference our discussion at your office.
                                             I am requesting you to load my
           1x 20 Kajaria container after 15th of January 2006 as am
           organising duties etc., by that time.

           With best regards,
                                Harshad Patel'
It is clear to me that this is not an instruction to hold the containers in
Mombasa indefinitely but an instruction to load the container not earlier
than 15th January 2006. The construction put upon the said email by the
applicants is the exact opposite of its import. The plaintiff was asking
the applicant to deliver the consignment, approximately 4 weeks, or a month
from the time of writing the message. This message, given its headers,
appears to have been written on 14th December 2005.
Secondly the email does not, as alleged by Mr. Sasi Nair, state that the
container should be held in Mombasa as Mr. Harshad Patel was looking for
money for freight charges and other dues. Mr. Harshad Patel, in the email
message clearly stated that the container should be loaded after 15th
January 2006 as he was 'organising duties etc., by that time.' There is
clearly no reference to freight and other charges presumably due to the
applicant. The reference in the message is to 'duties' which I presume are
due to the Government in the form of taxes.
Clearly the Mr. Sasi Nair, a director of the applicant, who swore the
affidavit in question, and attached this message is simply being
disingenuous in importing to the message what clearly is not available on
that message.
The applicant further contends that the plaintiff's claim, in the plaint,
that it paid all dues is false as there is an outstanding sum of US$800.00.
A statement of account is attached showing the plaintiff's account with the
applicant. It shows that two invoices were raised on 17 and 18 November
2005 for a total of US$8,034.06 by the defendant/applicant. It also shows
payments by the plaintiff from 12 November 2005 to 6 December 2005
totalling to US$7,200.00.
It is clear that by the time the email message referred to above by the
applicant, which must have been written on or about the 14th December 2005,
the applicants were already in receipt of approximately 90% of the funds
reflected on their invoices, and leaving a balance of only US$800.00. The
respondent had paid the bulk of the applicant's invoiced charges in respect
of this transaction.
Of course the applicant may be entitled to the US$800.00, that it alleges
the respondent has not paid, but the applicant has not indicated any desire
to counter claim for the same, either, on its application or on the
proposed written statement of defence.
On the basis of the facts that are evident on the application and the
supporting documents put forth by the applicant, in particular the email
message and the statement of account, it cannot be said, as the applicant
has attempted to do, that the respondent/plaintiff has no claim on the
applicant. This defence is not an arguable defence given the documentary
evidence put forth by the applicant itself on this application. The
applicant's position is not credible at all. It is a sham defence.
The applicant may well have a good reason as to why the respondent's
consignment of goods is not in Kampala. Unfortunately such reason has not
been stated in its application before me or in its proposed defence in this
matter. In effect the applicant has failed to show an arguable or a good
defence to the suit in this case. The applicant has therefore failed to
satisfy one of the conditions necessary for this court to exercise its
discretion and allow the applicant to proceed with the defence of this suit
on its merits.
Notwithstanding the fact that this application has been brought without
delay, and that prejudice occasioned to the respondent could possibly be
compensated for by costs, the applicant has failed to show that it has any
defence to the plaintiff's suit. I accordingly dismiss this application
with costs.
Signed, dated and delivered this 4th day of October 2006
