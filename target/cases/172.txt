INFOTECH SYSTEMS LTD APPLICANT/DEFENDANT

VERSUS

RAPS (U) LTD RESPONDENT/PLAINTIFF



Application to set aside a decree entered in the head suit after dismissing
an application for leave to appear and defend for lack of prosecution-Order
33 rule 11, order 48 rule 1 and section 98 of the civil procedure act.
Brief facts:
The plaintiff's advocate mistakenly entered the wrong date in his diary and
he communicated that same wrong date to the client. On the day that
application came for hearing they were not in court, as a result of this
mistake.
Issues:
Whether the applicant has a defence on the merits.

Held:
The applicant not only failed to disclose any facts that may entitle it to
defend, but the applicant had not in fact simultaneously applied for leave
to appear and defend which it ought to have done.-The excuse may have been
sufficient to explain the absence of counsel and his client from court on
that day, but taken alone it was not sufficient to vacate a decree lawfully
entered, as it had failed to show if it was entitled to defend the suit on
the merits. Application dismissed with costs.

               BEFORE: THE HON. MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

                                   RULING
1. The applicant is seeking to set aside the decree entered in the head
suit on 8th June 2005 after dismissing its application for leave to appear
and defend for lack of prosecution. This application is made under Order 33
rule 11, order 48 rule 1 and Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Act. The
application seeks no further orders except for provision of costs to be
made. Surprisingly it does not seek leave to appear and defend.
2. The grounds of the application are that the advocate for the plaintiff
mistakenly entered the wrong date in his diary and he communicated that
same wrong date to the client. On the day that application came for hearing
they were not in court, as a result of this mistake. Mr. Baguma Rogers, the
managing director, has sworn an affidavit to that effect. It is not
contested.
3. Mr. Fred Ruhindi, learned counsel for the applicant, submitted that the
failure of the advocate to turn up was due to a mistake of the advocate and
the consequences of this mistake should not be visited on the party.
4. Mr. Obonyo, learned counsel for the respondent opposed this application.
He submitted that in an application of this nature, the applicant must also
show that it has a good defence to the merits of the case. He referred this
court to the decision of Caltex Oil (U) Ltd v Kyobe HCCS No.89 of 1990
[unreported]. He further submitted that the applicant had failed in his
application to show that he has a good defence.
5. Order 33 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules provides the court with
the discretion to set aside decrees already entered under Order 33 where
service of summons was not effective or for other good cause. The court is
authorised to grant leave to the applicant to appear and defend.
6. In applications for setting aside a decree under Order 33 Rule 11, it is
usual to include a prayer to be granted leave to appear and defend, as this
may, in effect, be the reason why ultimately, it is sought to set aside the
decree. This would enable an applicant to proceed and put its case before
the court in accordance with the rules. It may be tactless for an applicant
who wishes to set aside a decree not to seek leave, at the same time, to
appear and defend as consideration of the application for setting aside a
decree lawfully entered, would necessitate inquiring into whether the
applicant has a defence on the merits.
7. In J. Hodge v P.E. Page HCCS No.75 of 1958 [unreported] considering
application to set aside a decree under rule 11, McKisack, C.J., held that
before an application to set aside a judgment regularly obtained, could be
granted, the court had to be satisfied not only that the defendant had had
a reasonable excuse, (e.g. illness) for failing to enter an appearance, but
also as to his "merits" i.e., (his prospects of success in the action).
8. In Caltex Oil (U) Ltd v Kyobe (supra), Byamugisha, J., (as she then
was), considering an application under Order 33 Rule 11, held that as to
whether the applicant should be granted leave to appear and defend the test
to be applied was whether he had disclosed such facts as might be deemed
sufficient to entitle him to defend.
9. Clearly in the case before me the applicant had not only failed to
disclose any facts that may entitle it to defend, but the applicant had not
in fact simultaneously applied for leave to appear and defend under Order
33 Rule 11 of the Civil Procedure Rules which it ought to have done.
10. The applicant has provided an excuse as to why it did not turn up in
court when its application came up for hearing. I agree that the excuse may
be sufficient to explain the absence of counsel and his client from court
on that day, but taken alone it is not sufficient to vacate a decree
lawfully entered, as it has failed to show if it is entitled to defend the
suit on the merits.
11. This application is dismissed with costs.
