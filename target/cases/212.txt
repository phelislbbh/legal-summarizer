APPLICANT

VERSUS

UGANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY                                    RESPONDENT

Legislation referred to:
Tax Appeals Tribunal Act


BEFORE: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE FMS EGONDA-NTENDE

RULING

The applicant, Kampala City Council, is seeking that this court extends the
time within which the applicant can file an appeal against a decision of
the Tax Appeals Tribunal in TAT Application number 23 of 2006 made on 11th
May 2007. The applicant contends that its failure to file a notice of
appeal in time was caused by a combination of factors not attributable to
the applicant. These factors were that the tribunal did not give to the
applicant a notice of the day the ruling would be delivered. Secondly that
the applicant's advocate made a mistake in the computation of time for
filing for an appeal. Thirdly that it is in the interests of justice and
will cause no prejudice to the respondent if the extension of time to file
an appeal was granted. In support of this application an affidavit sworn by
Florence Kabenge, advocate in the applicant's counsel law firm, was filed.
The respondent filed an affidavit in opposition sworn by Mr. Moses Kazibwe
Kawumi.
This application is made under Section 27(1) of the Tax Appeals Tribunal
Act. It appears to me that it is not only sub section 1 that is relevant
but the sub section 2 of the same section is equally relevant to this
application. I will set it out both.
                   '27 (1) A party to a proceeding before a tribunal may,
                   within thirty days after being notified of the decision
                   or within such further time as the High Court may allow,
                   lodge a notice of appeal with the registrar of the High
                   Court, and the party so appealing shall serve a copy of
                   the notice of appeal on the other party to the proceeding
                   before the tribunal.
                                                       (2) An appeal to the
                   High Court may be made on questions of law only, and the
                   notice of appeal shall state the question or questions of
                   law that will be raised on the appeal.'
It appears to me that only appeals on points of law may be allowed at this
stage for all appeals against the tribunal decisions in accordance with
Section 27(2) of the Act. Where an appeal has not been filed in time, the
High Court is granted the power to extend such further time as it may
decide. The provisions do not state on what grounds the High Court may
exercise its discretion.
This carte blanche allowed to the courts must be exercised bearing in mind
the statutory scheme of this Act. If only appeals on points of law may be
taken against the tribunal decisions, it would be imperative in my view, on
an application of this nature for the applicant, not only to explain as to
why in the first place it did not take benefit of the time provided for
filing an appeal, but must also show that that there is a point of law to
be taken on the appeal. It may show this by attaching to its application
the proposed notice of appeal which would contain the grounds of appeal. It
may show this in the application itself for leave. I find that it is
imperative that the applicant demonstrates that there is a point of law to
be taken on the appeal.
The applicant has not done so in the instant application. The application
does not disclose that the intended appeal is over a point of law. Neither
is the proposed notice of appeal attached to this application to enable
this court satisfy itself that the intended appeal shall be within the
confines permitted by statute.
The applicant's affidavit deals only with the facts related to the error of
counsel in computing the time for appeal and the discovery by the
applicant's counsel of the ruling a week after it was delivered. As was
pointed out by the counsel for the respondent at the hearing of the
application, 23 days was still sufficient time for diligent counsel to
file. Even if an allowance was made for the 7 days, and time was to run
from the date of the applicant's counsel received the ruling, the applicant
was nevertheless still out of time. Nevertheless even if this point were
taken in favour of the applicant, and taken to have significantly
disadvantaged him, the failure to articulate, in a meaningful manner, that
the intended appeal is over a point of law, is in my view, fatal to this
application.
This application is dismissed with costs.
Signed, dated, delivered at Kampala this 14th day of November 2007
