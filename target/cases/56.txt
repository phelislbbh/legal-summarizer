 THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA.                 IN THE COURT OF APPEAL OF UGANDA, AT KAMPALA.  CORAM:       HON. JUSTICE L.E.M. MUKASA-KIKONYOGO, DCJ.       HON. JUSTICE A.E.N. MPAGI-BAHIGEINE, JA.       HON. JUSTICE C.K. BYAMUGISHA, JA.                              CIVIL APPEAL NO.29/2002          MUBARAKA BATESAKI:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::APPELLANT.                                    VERSUS         MUBARAKA MAGALA:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::RESPONDENT   [Appeal from the Judgement of the High Court of Jinja at Jinja (Y. Bamwine             J.), dated 17/10/2001 in Civil Appeal No. 4 of 1999]     JUDGEMENT OF A.E. MPAGI-BAHIGEINE, JA.   This is a second appeal.  The appellant, Mubaraka  Batesaki,  unsuccessfully appealed to the High court at Jinja (Y. Bamwine. J.) against  the  dismissal of his claim, by the Chief Magistrate, Iganga on 31/3/1999.  The background facts were that,  by  a  written  agreement  dated  3/1/1996, Mubaraka Magala, hereinafter the respondent, sold his motor  vehicle,  Hiace Minibus, to Mubaraka Batesaki, hereafter the appellant, at Shs 3,800,000  of which Shs 2.500,000/= cash was paid on the day  of  the  agreement  and  the appellant took possession of the vehicle, but without  the  log  book.   The balance of 1.300,000/= was agreed to be paid in  two  equal  instalments  of Shs 650,000/= on 30/3.1996 and 15/4/1996 respectively.   It  was  then  that the appellant would receive the logbook.  When the appellant failed to pay the instalments  the  respondent  proceeded to repossess the vehicle on 15/6/1996, two  months  after  the  agreed  last date of payment.  He  thereafter  filed  suit  on  13/1/1997,  seven  months later, for recovery of the unpaid balance.  The trial magistrate dismissed the suit and ordered  that  the  sum  of  Shs 2.500,000/= paid by  the  appellant  to  the  respondent  be  refunded  with interest from the date of the agreement.  Each party  was  ordered  to  meet its own costs.  The appellate Judge upholding the magistrate's order  of  dismissal  of  the claim, set aside the order for the refund of  Shs  2.500,000/=  and  ordered that it be retained by the  respondent  together  with  the  vehicle.   Each party was to meet its own costs.  The memorandum of appeal comprises the following grounds, namely: 1. That the learned Judge erred in law and fact  and  reached  on  erroneous    decision  when  he  held  that  the  appellant  was  entitled  to  retain    possession of both the vehicle and the deposit of Shs 2.5 million when he    had found:-  . That it was wrongful for the appellant to have repossessed the vehicle.  . That the proper course of action was to sue for breach of contract where    he (appellant) would be considered for compensatory damages.  . That once the contract was considered repudiated, and the plaintiff  was    in possession of the vehicle, the suit for recovery of  the  balance  on    the purchase price was unmaintainable. 2. That the learned Judge erred when he made an award to the respondent  to    retain  possession  of  both  the  vehicle  and  the  deposit   of   Shs    2.500,000/=, a remedy that had not been pleaded or claimed  for  by  the    respondent both on appeal and in the final court. 3. That the learned Judge erred in law  and  in  fact  when  he  failed  to    properly re-evaluate the evidence  on  record,  and  instead  considered    matters relating to  mitigation  damages  and  depreciation  which  were    neither supported by any evidence nor raised in the lower  court,  hence    reaching a wrong decision. 4. That the learned Judge erred to base his findings on a counter -  claim,    which had already been shuck off in the trial court. 5. That the learned Judge erred to deny the appellant costs of  the  appeal    when the appeal was substantially dismissed.'  The respondent filed written  submissions  while  learned  counsel  for  the appellant argued viva voce. Mr. Shaban Muziransa represented the appellant.  Mr. Mugenyi  Ivan  was  for the respondent.  Regarding ground no. 1, Mr. Muziransa, learned  counsel  for  the  appellant argued that the learned Judge reached an erroneous decision in holding  that the appellant was entitled to retain both the vehicle  and  deposit  of  Shs 2.500,000/=.  The proper course  would  have  been  to  sue  for  breach  of contract and the respondent would  be  considered  for  damages.   Once  the respondent was in possession of the vehicle, the suit for  recovery  of  the balance of the purchase price was unmaintainable. He pointed out that once the vendor parted with possession of the goods,  he lost his lien hereon, he could only sue for breach of contract.   Possession having been handed over to the appellant, the  respondent  should  not  have impounded it but should only have sued for the balance.  In support  of  his submissions  he  cited  the  case  of  Dies  And  Another  vs  British   and International Mining and Finance Corporation Limited (1939) I.K.B 724  where part of the purchase price and a deposit were distinguished.  A  deposit  is forfeitable on the purchaser's default while a part payment  is  refundable. The  respondent  was  not  entitled  to  keep  both  the  vehicle  and  Shs. 2,500,000/-.  For the respondent, it was argued  that  the  learned  Judge  exercised  his inherent powers to order that the respondent do  retain  possession  of  the vehicle and the deposit.  He had such powers under 039 rule 2 of  the  Civil Procedure Rules.  He had powers to go beyond the  grounds  of  objection  in the memorandum of appeal. He relied on Jane Bwiriza vs  John  Nathan  Osapil SCCA No. 5 of 2002 at page 15 - 17 of the  judgement  of  Hon  Odoki  C.  J, Stockloser vs Johnson (1954) A.E.R 630, amongst others.  The learned Judge held:       "... it is settled law that in a  case  of  breach  of  contract,  the      innocent party may  elect  to  enforce  the  performance  of  the  said      contract or opt to sue for damages for the said breach.  I take that to      be the correct legal position..... this was not a hiring agreement.  It      was an agreement of sale, the property was not to pass until the  whole      of the purchase price was paid.  Appellant ensured that this was so  by      retaining the logbook. By impounding the vehicle, the  vendor  must  be      assumed to have regarded the breach as serial, going to the  very  root      of the contract.  Having  taken  the  course  he  did,  he  disentitled      himself to sue for the balance of  the  purchase  price.   The  learned      trial Chief Magistrate  was  entitled  to  reject  his  claim  for  Shs      1,300,000/= in the circumstances of the case.   The  proper  course  of      action was to sue  for  the  breach  of  contract  where  he  would  be      considered for compensatory damages.  He did not adopt that  procedure.      He  can  not  be  heard  to  complain  that  he  was  not  offered  any      remedies....        Accordingly  the  judgement  of  the  lower  court   dismissing   the      plaintiff's suit is upheld.  The order of refund of Shs  2.5million  to      the respondent is set aside.  The appellant is  entitled  to  repossess      the vehicle and retain the deposit..."  It appears that the terms 'appellant' and 'respondent' are cross applied  at times by the learned Judge.  He refers to the 'appellant' when it should  be the 'respondent' and vice versa.  However, be that as it may, the  agreement of sale was very, simple and brief.  It ran along these lines:        "I, Mubaraka Magala of Nakasubi  Bugweri,  have  sold  my  vehicle  to       Mubaraka Batesaki of Nakasubi Bugweri Type of  vehicle  Hiace  Minibus       REG No 3Y - 0589488.       CHASSIS No YH 61V - 0058507        COLOR  -  WHITE        MODEL  -  1987       I have sold it to him at only  Shs  3.800,000/=.   He  has  part  paid       2.500,000/=.  He remains with a balance of  1.300,000/=  to  pay.   He       will be paying 650,000/= on 30/3/1996.  The balance, he  will  pay  on       15/4/1996 without any excuse whatsoever."   The retention of the logbook was not embodied  in  the  said  agreement.  It was, however, not a disputed fact.  I think the issue is whether the Shs 2.500,000/= was a deposit or just  part payment of the purchase price.   It  was  dealt  with  by  Denning  L  J  in Stockloser vs Johnson (1954) I.A.E.R 630   at 637, thus:        "It seems to me that the cases show the law to be this:      When there is no forfeiture clause, if money is  handed  over  in  part       payment of the purchase piece, and then the buyer makes default as  to       the balance, then, so long as the seller keeps the contract  open  and       available for performance, the buyer cannot recover the money but once       the seller rescinds the contract or treats it as at an  end  owing  to       the buyer's default, then the buyer is entitled to recover  his  money       by action at  law,  subject  to  a  cross  claim  by  the  seller  for       damages.....".   It is  apparent  that  there  was  no  forfeiture  clause  in  the  sale  of agreement.  The cash down Shs 2.500,000/= was thus clearly in  part  payment of the purchase price. The sum was quite a  substantial  percentage  of  the purchase price.  It was clearly not a mere deposit as found by  the  learned Judge.   Once the respondent  had  decided  to  repossess  the  vehicle,  he thereby put the contract at an end.  He repudiated it.  The buyer thereby became entitled to a refund  of  his  2.500,000/=  he  had paid.  It was not a deposit to ensure performance which  is  not  refundable but part payment of the purchase price  which  was  refundable  -  Dies  And Another vs British And International F. C. Limited  (1939)  I.K.B.  724.  As rightly pointed out by the learned Judge, the respondent had the  option  of not impounding the vehicle but suing for breach of  contract  since  he  had the additional security of the logbook in his possession.  He would thus  be compensated in damages covering the balance of the purchase price  and  non- use of his vehicle.  Omer vs A Besse Ltd (1960) E A 907.  He  chose  not  to follow this course.  He is bound to refund the 2.500,000/=.   The learned Judge was thus in error on this point.   In an attempt to  avoid a multiplicity of suits  he  purported  to  compensate  the  respondent  for breach of contract and non-use of the vehicle by allowing him  to  keep  the part payment of the purchase price of Shs. 2,500,000/-. I think this was  an error. These matters were never pleaded and were thus not properly  assessed by the Judge.  As  a  trial  Judge,  he  had  the  opportunity  of  ordering amendments to the pleadings on which evidence could  be  adduced  to  assist him reach a just decision.  The appellant buyer is thus entitled to recover his Shs  2.500,000/=.   This disposes of grounds 1, 2, 3 and 4, which I would allow.  Ground 5 concerns the issue of costs. The learned Judge ordered each party to meet the costs of  its  advocate  in the High Court and the court below. The appellant  objected  that  since  he was the successful party he should have been awarded costs.  The  respondent contended that the award of costs being discretionary,  the  order  made  by the learned Judge was justified  and  could  not  be  interfered  with.  The learned Judge considered the conduct of each party when making the order.   I entirely agree with him that none of the parties to  the  suit  had  clean hands.  The appellant / buyer breached the agreement he  had  undertaken  to honour without fail.  The respondent / seller rushed to impound the  vehicle in-spite of the fact that he had the  logbook  in  his  possession  and  had received a substantial part of the purchase price.  He could only have  sued in damages. In Devram Nanji Dattani vs Haridas K Dawda (1949), 16  EACA  35.   Where  it was held that  a  successful  party  can  be  deprived  of  his  costs,  the following passage was referred to:         "It is well established that when the decision of such a matter as the       right of a successful litigant,  to  recover  costs  is  left  to  the       discretion of the Judge who tried  his  case,  that  discretion  is  a       judicial discretion, and if it be so its exercise  must  be  based  on       facts.... If, however, there be, in fact, some grounds to support  the       exercise by the trial Judge of the discretion he purports to exercise,       the question of the sufficiency of those grounds for this  purpose  is       entirely a matter for the Judge himself to decide, and  the  court  of       Appeal will not interfere with the discretion in that instance.'   Per       Lord Atkinson in Donald Compbell vs Pollock, (1927) A.  C.  732  at  p       813".   This passage is on all fours with section 27 (1) Civil Procedure  Act  which the Judge must have followed. It gives him full powers  and  the  discretion to determine by whom and out of what property and to what extent  costs  are to be paid. Thus this court cannot interfere with that discretion as  it  is apparent that it was exercised unjudicially or based  on  wrong  principles.   This ground of appeal would in my view fail.  As indicated  above,  I  would allow this appeal partially.  I would also order each  party  to  bear  it's own costs.
