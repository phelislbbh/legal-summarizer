JUDGEMENT OF THE COURT.


This appeal is against conviction and sentence.


The appellant, Bernard Kalyegira, was indicted and  convicted  by  the  High
Court at Fort-portal for the offence of defilement contrary to  section  123
of the  Penal  Code  Act  (Chapter  120).  He  was  sentenced  to  12  years
imprisonment. Hence this appeal.

The background facts were that on or about  the  27th  May  2000,  at  Futi,
Butangwa village, Karambi sub-county, Kabarole District,  when  the  victim,
then aged 7 years, was returning home from school,  the  appellant  who  was
following behind caught up with her. He grabbed her and  dragged  her  to  a
nearby banana plantation where, he threw her down, pulled off her  underwear
and had sexual intercourse with her. She felt a lot of pain.

As the appellant lay on top of the victim, he was  seen  and  recognized  by
two other school children, Mutegeki Joseph Pw3 and  Baseimana  Betrice  Pw4,
who were going down the same path.

When the victim returned home she  feared  to  inform  her  mother,  Harriet
Night, Pw1, of what had happened to her. However on 29th May,  Pw1,  noticed
that the victim was walking awkwardly. On  examining  the  victim's  private
parts, Pw1, detected a pus  discharge.  The  victim  then  narrated  to  her
mother what the appellant had done to her. Pw1 reported the  matter  to  the
Local Council authorities, whereupon the appellant was arrested  and  handed
over to Karambi Police Post. The  medical  examination  confirmed  that  the
victim had been defiled.

At the trial, the appellant gave an unsworn statement setting up  an  alibi,
which the learned Judge rejected and convicted him as charged.

The Memorandum of appeal comprises seven ground, namely;-

      "1. The learned Judge erred in  law  and  fact    when  he  failed  to
      correctly evaluate the appellant's evidence.


     2. That the learned trial Judge erred in law and fact  in  relying  on
        prosecution  evidence  which  was  full   of   contradictions   and
        discrepancies and went ahead to convict the appellant.


     3. That the learned trial Judge misdirected himself in  fact  and  law
        when he relied on circumstantial evidence to reach his decision  to
        convict the appellant.


      4. The learned trial Judge erred in fact and  law  when  he  convicted
         the  appellant  using  uncorroborated   evidence   of   prosecution
         witnesses.


      5. The learned trial Judge erred in law and  fact  when  he  held  the
         appellant guilty of defilement.


      6. The learned trial Judge misdirected himself when he relied  on  the
         weakness of the defence case  as  the  basis  of  his  decision  to
         convict the appellant.


      7. The trial Judge erred in law when he allowed the trial  to  proceed
         without the assessors being sworn in."


Mr. Robert Tumwine, learned counsel, for  the  appellant  decided  to  argue
grounds 3,4 and 5 together, abandoning the rest.





Arguing grounds 3,4 and 5, Mr. Tumwine pointed out that  the  learned  Judge
relied on circumstantial evidence, which was not corroborated and found  the
appellant guilty. In his view when the victim testified that  the  appellant
was found on top of her, this was circumstantial  evidence,  which  was  not
corroborated by medical evidence to show penetration. He asserted  that  the
medical evidence adduced was lacking, in  that  respect.  It  merely  showed
that her private parts were tender but that there were  no  penetration.  He
submitted that the vulva inflammation caused by rubbing as indicated by  the
medical report was circumstantial evidence of bodily contact and  the  Judge
should have interpreted it in favour of  the  appellant  and  convicted  the
appellant of indecent assault.





Mr. Tumwine further pointed out that the learned Judge considered  the  fact
that since the appellant was a porter in the  banana  plantation  where  the
victim said she was defiled, it was possible that it was the  appellant  who
had defiled her. He contended that the learned Judge  ought  to  have  given
the benefit of this doubt to the appellant.





In reply Ms Jane  Okuo,  learned  Senior  State  Attorney  prayed  court  to
dismiss the appeal for lack of  merit.  She  submitted  that  circumstantial
evidence, which is capable of standing  by  itself,  does  not  have  to  be
corroborated. Be that as it may, the learned trial Judge  relied  on  direct
evidence  by  eyewitnesses.  The  victim's  evidence  was   therefore   ably
corroborated by other evidence. She pointed out that there was  evidence  of
penetration, however slight it was and coupled with the  pus  discharge,  it
was enough to show there had been penetration.


The learned trial Judge held:-


            "On the issue of  whether  or  not  there  was  unlawful  sexual
      intercourse, the defence  contention  is  that  according  to  medical
      evidence produced by the prosecution, there was only vulval rubbing or
      intercourse without penetration. According to this  Clinical  Officer,
      the hymen was not ruptured. Penetration in sexual offences,  is  being
      described in Archibold Criminal Pleading, Evidence Act Practice,  36th
      Edition paragraph 2879 as follows:-


      'To constitute the offence of Rape  there  must  be  penetration.  But
      any, even the slightest,  penetration  will  be  sufficient.  Where  a
      penetration was proved, but not of such depth as to injure the  hymen,
      still it was held to be sufficient to constitute  the  case  of  Rape.
      Proof of the rupture of the hymen is unnecessary ...........'





The above principle are equally applicable to cases of defilement.


In the instant case the victim stated that the accused slept on top  of  her
and defiled her. Two other kids found him on top of her.  According  to  Mr.
Mugarura apart from the inflammation of the vulva caused by  vulval  rubbing
or intercourse the one between the vagina and the anus was tender  and  this
was caused by something that was forced into the vagina, so to us there  was
penetration. But considering the age of the girl, full penetration as  would
result with rupture of the hymen  was  not  possible.  A  similar  situation
arose in the case (sic) of Dan Mubiru v  Uganda  (Criminal  Appeal  No.4  of
1996) (unreported), where the Court of Appeal, of Uganda stated as follows;-



            "We do not accept the argument that because the penetration  was
           not complete there  was  no  penetration  to  constitute  carnal
           knowledge for it is trite law that the slightest penetration  is
           sufficient".


      I respectfully agree. The injuries  found  by  Mr.  Mugarura  indicate
      that there was penetration (however slight)  that  was  sufficient  to
      constitute sexual intercourse".





We cannot fault the learned Judge's application of  the  law  to  the  facts
before him.





Apparently Mr. Tumwine did  not  challenge  the  issue  of  the  appellant's
identity, only the offence of defilement,  which  he  considered,  ought  to
have been substituted with that of indecent assault. There was  no  question
of circumstantial evidence as argued by counsel. All evidence relied  on  by
the learned Judge was direct. The appellant was seen lying  on  top  of  the
victim by two school children Pw2 and Pw4. This was in a  banana  plantation
in which the appellant worked and not far from the path  Pw3  and  Pw4  were
taking  from  school.  The  Medical  report   EXP1   as   indicated   above,
sufficintetly corroborated the victim's  story  that  she  had  indeed  been
defiled and not only indecently assaulted.





Grounds 3,4 and 5 thus fail.





With leave of Court, learned counsel introduced an appeal against  sentence.
He argued that the 12 years prison term did not depict leniency on the  part
of the court though the Judge had conceded that the appellant  was  a  first
offender and had spent 24 months  on  remand  during  which  period  he  had
contracted TB and other ailments. Learned counsel prayed court to set  aside
the conviction and sentence of 12 years and substitute the  conviction  with
one for  indecent  assault  and  a  sentence,  which  would  result  in  the
appellant's immediate release. He did not cite any cases.





Learned  State  Attorney  opposed  any   interference   with   the   judge's
discretion.





It is trite that sentence is a matter of the discretion  of  the  Judge.  An
appellate  court  can  only  interfere  with  a  Judge's  exercise  of   his
discretion on the following grounds where;-





      a) It is evident that the trial judge acted on a wrong principle, or,


      b) The trial Judge overlooked some material factors, or,


      c) The sentence is manifestly excessive in circumstances of the  case
         or inordinately too low so  as  to  amount  to  a  miscarriage  of
         justice.


James s/o Yovan v R (1951) 18 EACA 147, The Learned Judge was informed  that
the appellant was a first offender, had been on remand  for  two  years.  He
was suffering from TB and other related ailments.


He took all above into account when passing the 12 years prison term.


Considering the age difference between the appellant aged 39  and  his  poor
health; his victim aged 7 years and the high probability of her  contracting
AIDs, we cannot interfere with the Judge's discretion. The 12  years  prison
term is well deserved. It is regrettable that there was no  cross-appeal  on
sentence.





The appeal thus fails in toto and is dismissed forthwith.
